TI Magnetic resonance microscopy of prenatal dolphins (Mammalia,
   Odontoceti, Delphinidae) - Ontogenetic and phylogenetic implications
SO ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER
AB The structure of two preserved prenatal dolphins were visualized by 3D MR microscopy (isotropic nominal resolution up to 78.1 mu m), which is a high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. To determine the benefits and limitations of this method, the acquired 3D datasets were segmented manually and compared to histological sections of different specimens in corresponding developmental stages. The MR images visualize the external and internal morphology of both prenatal dolphins in detail. Various organ systems with their main components are clearly documented in the images, allowing a complete segmentation of the specimens and the calculation of volumes and surface areas of different organ systems. Due to its non-invasive character and the detailed imaging within its resolution range, MR microscopy proves to be a valuable tool in developmental biology for the visualization of the inner architecture of rare and delicate museum specimens, such as the small dolphin embryo and fetus examined. In these two prenatal dolphins, the profound structural modifications at the transition from the embryonic to the fetal stage reflect the adaptations of the mammalian bauplan to the requirements of a holaquatic cetacean life-style. However, the developmental pattern and sequence of the emerging tissues and organs in prenatal life do not resemble the hypothesized evolution of the structural and functional adaptations found in the fossil record.

TI Abundance Estimate of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the
   Lower River Shannon candidate Special Area of Conservation, Ireland
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB An abundance assessment of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Lower River Shannon candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) was undertaken between July and October 2010 using photo-identification. European Union Member States are obliged to designate SACs for bottlenose dolphins to protect important habitats. The Lower River Shannon is the only cSAC in Ireland for this species. A cumulative total of 273 bottlenose dolphins were photographed during the 12 transects, and from these a total of 116 individual animals were identified. They were categorized as follows: 71 with Severity Grade 1 marks, 21 with Severity Grade 2 marks, and 24 with Severity Grade 3 marks. There were 50 dolphins with permanent marks (Severity Grade 1) recorded on both sides of the dorsal fin, 64 on the left hand side only, and 57 on the right hand side only. There was an overlap, with some dolphins occurring in more than one category. Estimates of abundance were calculated using left side, right side, and both side identifications. The proportion of dolphins with re-identifiable marks (Severity Grade 1 only) ranged from 0.60 to 0.63. The estimated abundance of marked individuals was elevated depending on the estimated proportion of marked individuals in the population to give a final estimate of 107 +/- 12, CV = 0.12 (95% CI = 83 to 131). Previous abundance estimates for bottlenose dolphins in the Lower River Shannon cSAC ranged from 114 in 2008 to 140 in 2006; the present estimate was within this range and also within the 95% Confidence Intervals for all surveys carried out to date. This suggests that, within the power of the survey technique, the population of bottlenose dolphins in the Lower River Shannon cSAC is relatively stable.

TI Behavioral Responses and Habituation of Pinnipeds and Small Cetaceans to
   Novel Objects and Simulated Fishing Gear With and Without a Pinger
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Marine mammals are vulnerable to entanglement in nets and lines. To quantify their interactions with fishing gear, pinnipeds and small cetaceans were exposed to novel objects and simulated fishing gear in a zoological environment at SeaWorld San Diego. The objects included a line, a frame covered with gillnetting, and a pinger. Exposures were delivered using a baseline-exposure protocol, documenting naive responses and using repeated trials to measure habituation or sensitization. Responses to objects paired with the pinger differed strikingly from others, stimulating behaviors consistent with aversion in all species. Among pinnipeds, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) left the test pool or touched the pinger-associated object less often, although some eventually manipulated it extensively. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) reacted initially with avoidance, defensive, and agonistic behaviors. However, they quickly returned to baseline activities and readily took fish from pingered nets. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) reacted the least. Among the cetaceans, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and a Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) did not manipulate the objects but made fast investigative or agonistic passes near them. Jaw claps and surface-active behaviors were most common during pinger trials. Commerson's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) responded particularly strongly. Counts of some defensive or agonistic behaviors differed dramatically in the presence vs absence of the pinger, including bows (70 vs 0), roostertailing (117 vs 0), and fluke slaps (76 vs 2). Across seven trials, avoidance time in a refuge pool rose to > 90%, indicating sensitization. However, pinnipeds startled through gillnetting, and Commerson's dolphins charged it deliberately in spite of the pinger. Based on these experiments, it is more likely that pingers reduce entanglement by arousing aversion than by warning marine mammals to avoid a hazard.

TI Evidence of Osedax worm borings in Pliocene (similar to 3 Ma) whale bone
   from the Mediterranean
SO HISTORICAL BIOLOGY
AB Osedax worms subsist entirely on vertebrate skeletons on the seafloor, using root-like tissues to bore into and degrade the bones. Paleontologists have only recently begun to appreciate the possible destructive effect that these worms may have had on the marine vertebrate fossil record and little is known of their evolutionary history. Using microcomputed tomography, we document Osedax-like borings in a fossil whale bone from the Pliocene of Italy and present new data on the borings of extant Osedax worms. The fossil borings are distinguished from those of other known borers and identified as traces of Osedax activity based on diagnostic features. Our results suggest that it is necessary to isolate individual borings for the confident identification of Osedax traces. This is only the second paleogeographic occurrence of Osedax in the fossil record and indicates that by the Pliocene these worms had colonised a large portion of the world's oceans. This is the first evidence for Osedax in the Mediterranean, past or present, and suggests that more species await discovery in this region.

TI Postcranial morphology and locomotion of the Eocene raoellid Indohyus
   (Artiodactyla: Mammalia)
SO HISTORICAL BIOLOGY
AB Raoellids are small, raccoon-sized Eocene artiodactyls, closely related to archaic cetaceans (archaeocetes) that have poor representation of postcranial elements in the fossil record. Little is known of the aquatic and terrestrial locomotor affinities of raoellids due to the paucity of their fossil record, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the earliest portion of the artiodactyl marine invasion. To address this gap, a comparative morphological analysis of the postcranial elements was undertaken based on newly recovered elements of the raoellid Indohyus, archaeocetes and extant artiodactyls. Greater than 200 postcranial elements of Indohyus were described, and some limb element cross-sections were visualised via paleohistological thin sections and CT scans. Results show that during terrestrial locomotion, Indohyus probably had a digitigrade posture and mediolaterally stabilised limbs that functioned mostly in flexion and extension within the parasagittal plane. Quantification of midshaft cross-sectional area for some elements of Indohyus showed an osteosclerotic cortex, a skeletal characteristic associated with aquatic behaviours. Indohyus may represent a critical intermediate in the evolution of the cetacean terrestrial-to-aquatic body plan, as it bears gracile postcranial element proportions similar to a terrestrial artiodactyl but also an incipient form of osteosclerosis compared to pakicetid archaeocetes.

TI Global analysis of cetacean line-transect surveys: detecting trends in
   cetacean density
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Measuring the effect of anthropogenic change on cetacean populations is hampered by our lack of understanding about population status and a lack of power in the available data to detect trends in abundance. Often long-term data from repeated surveys are lacking, and alternative approaches to trend detection must be considered. We utilised an existing database of line-transect survey records to determine whether temporal trends could be detected when survey effort from around the world was combined. We extracted density estimates for 25 species and fitted generalised additive models (GAMs) to investigate whether taxonomic, spatial or methodological differences among systematic line-transect surveys affect estimates of density and whether we can identify temporal trends in the data once these factors are accounted for. The selected GAM consisted of 2 parts: an intercept term that was a complex interaction of taxonomic, spatial and methodological factors and a smooth temporal term with trends varying by family and ocean basin. We discuss the trends found and assess the suitability of published density estimates for detecting temporal trends using retrospective power analysis. In conclusion, increasing sample size through combining survey effort across a global scale does not necessarily result in sufficient power to detect trends because of the extent of variability across surveys, species and oceans. Instead, results from repeated dedicated surveys designed specifically for the species and geographical region of interest should be used to inform conservation and management.

TI Stranded cetaceans as indicators of mercury pollution in the
   Mediterranean Sea
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB Concentrations of Hg were determined in tissues (muscle, heart, kidney, lung and liver) of two cetacean species (Stenella coeruleoalba and Tursiops truncatus) stranded along the Italian coasts during the period 2000-2009 and compared with those previously reported by other authors from different areas of the Mediterranean basin. The highest concentrations of Hg were found in liver samples of both species (8.4-1752 mg.kg(-1) dry weight for S. coeruleoalba and 9.6-1404 mg.kg(-1) d.w. for T. truncatus). Statistically significant dissimilarities of Hg concentrations were recorded in muscle and liver tissues of S. coeruleoalba stranded in different geographical areas of the Mediterranean Sea as apparent direct response to uneven impacts of Hg pollution in the basin. A noteworthy outcome was that cetaceans stranded on the French coasts showed significantly higher levels of Hg contamination than those from other Mediterranean areas while the eastern part of the basin evidences the lowest Hg concentrations in the studied organisms. Moreover, the results of this study tentatively suggest the existence of different sub-populations of the two species in the basin.

TI A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF LATE MIOCENE INIOID (CETACEA, ODONTOCETI)
   FROM THE MEHERRIN RIVER, NORTH CAROLINA, USA
SO JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY
AB A new genus and species of extinct inioid odontocete (Meherrinia isoni) is based on nine partial crania that probably originated from the late Miocene marine Eastover Formation in North Carolina, U. S. A. They were collected from the riverbed of the Meherrin River, a tributary of the Chowan River. Ossification of the mesethmoid and the tight interdigitation of many sutures indicate that these specimens represent mature individuals. Key characteristics of the new inioid include maxillae that 'squeeze' the nasals into a slight hourglass shape and supraoccipital that is deeply wedged between the frontals and maxillae on the vertex. As compared to the extant iniid Inia geoffrensis (Amazon River dolphin) and the extant pontoporiid Pontoporia blainvillei (La Plata dolphin), Meherrinia is more plesiomorphic in having less elevated premaxillary eminences and supraorbital processes. In other respects Meherrinia is intermediate in morphology between the two extant genera of inioids. For example, the essentially symmetrical vertex is intermediate in height between the low and high vertices in Pontoporia blainvillei and Inia geoffrensis, respectively. A cladistic analysis of morphological and molecular data supports a sister-group relationship between Meherrinia and Inia; thus our new taxon is tentatively assigned to the Iniidae. If correct, this is the first iniid represented by diagnostic remains from marine deposits and just the second from North America.

TI Spatial scale and environmental determinants in minke whale habitat use
   and foraging
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Because pelagic prey concentrations are patchy in both space and time, predators such as marine mammals require high degrees of flexibility in their habitat use. We tested the hypothesis that minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata adjust their habitat use during the feeding season at different spatial scales: their overall distribution should be determined by broad-scale oceanographic features, while foraging activity at finer scales should be dictated by short-term changes in habitat conditions. Results from generalized additive models indicate that minke whale distribution off the west coast of Scotland is dependent largely on temporally variable parameters (sea surface temperature in spring, chlorophyll concentration in autumn), in addition to depth and topography. However, fine-scale foraging behaviour was dictated by the strength and direction of tidal currents. Seasonal distribution patterns according to environmental parameters were largely consistent between 2 different spatial scales, and over a time period of 15 yr. Significantly higher sighting rates occurred in areas of predicted sandeel Ammodytes marinus presence in spring, but not during the rest of the summer, while in August and September, prey samples from the core study area consisted almost entirely of sprat Sprattus sprattus. The low energetic cost of swimming in minke whales and their ability to switch between different prey according to their seasonal availability thus appears to allow them to readily respond to temporal changes in pelagic prey concentrations at different scales. This occurs through a distribution influenced by temporally variable parameters (temperature and chlorophyll concentration), combined with adjustments in foraging activity dependent on variable conditions at fine spatial scales (tides).

TI A functional paradigm for evaluating culture: An example with cetaceans
SO CURRENT ZOOLOGY
AB Nonhuman culture was first considered in nonhuman primates because they are genetically similar to humans. However, evolution is not progressive and therefore many species may occupy niches that favor socially transmitted, group specific behavior. Not surprisingly, evidence for culture has accrued in several taxonomic groups, including cetaceans. If culture is an adaptation, it is imperative we understand the factors that favor its formation. Understanding the evolutionary origin of culture will allow for a wider range of species to be studied, including those that are difficult to test in the laboratory. I propose a broad-based functional paradigm for evaluating nonhuman culture; based on the idea that while not all cultural behaviors may garner fitness benefits to the individual, the ecological and social environments in which cultural behaviors evolved must have favored the physical attributes and social learning capabilities that allow for cultural formation. Specifically this framework emphasizes the relationships between social learning, ecology, social systems, and biology in relation to culture. I illustrate the utility of the functional paradigm with evidence from the ceteacean group, while setting the stage for a stringent species by species analysis. By means of contextualizing culture, the Functional Paradigm can evaluate a species' potential to exhibit culture and can investigate potentially cultural behaviors [Current Zoology 58 (2): 271-286, 2012].

TI Incorporating information on bottlenose dolphin distribution into marine
   protected area design
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB The steady growth of the whale-watching activities in the Azores and its concentration in a small area that partly overlaps the home range of a resident group of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) was one of the driving forces to proposing part of the range of this group as a marine protected area (MPA). Six years of data collected during boat surveys were used to investigate how dolphins used the candidate MPA (cMPA) and whether they showed any preference for the cMPA over adjacent areas. This work also estimated the fraction of the resident individuals and group's range included in the cMPA and examined whether there were any temporal changes in its use. Mean daily encounter rate of bottlenose dolphins was higher inside than outside the cMPA. Dolphin sightings inside the cMPA were nearly double what was predicted by the survey effort. Dolphins used the cMPA with similar intensity throughout the years. Resident dolphins were frequently sighted in the cMPA. However, less than 20% of the known range (650km2) and 41% (39km2) of the core area of the group lay within the cMPA. The reliability in the use of the cMPA over a 6-year period suggests its importance for the dolphin population remained relatively stable but its surface area was clearly insufficient to satisfy the spatial requirements of the resident group. Based on these findings, it was proposed to the Regional Government of the Azores to extend the boundaries of the cMPA. Accordingly, the modified protected area established in 2008 includes 100% of the core area of the resident group of bottlenose dolphins. This study provides an example of how information on cetacean habitat-use patterns may be used to design ecologically meaningful protected areas for this group.

TI Harbour porpoise habitat preferences: robust spatio-temporal inferences
   from opportunistic data
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Statistical habitat modelling is often flagged as a cost-effective decision tool for species management. However, data that can produce predictions with the desired precision are difficult to collect, especially for species with spatially extensive and dynamic distributions. Data from platforms of opportunity could be used to complement or help design dedicated surveys, but robust inference from such data is challenging. Furthermore, regression models using static covariates may not be sufficient for animals whose habitat preferences change dynamically with season, environmental conditions or foraging strategy. More flexible models introduce difficulties in selecting parsimonious models. We implemented a robust model-averaging framework to dynamically predict harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena occurrence in a strongly tidal and topographically complex site in southwest Wales using data from a temporally intensive platform of opportunity. Spatial and temporal environmental variables were allowed to interact in a generalized additive model (GAM). We used information criteria to examine an extensive set of 3003 models and average predictions from the best 33. In the best model, 3 main effects and 2 tensor-product interactions explained 46% of the deviance. Model-averaged predictions indicated that harbour porpoises avoided or selected steeper slopes depending on the tidal flow conditions; when the tide started to ebb, occurrence was predicted to increase 3-fold at steeper slopes.

TI Common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) habitat preferences using data from
   two platforms of opportunity
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Cetaceans are difficult to observe in the wild, and demand complex logistics for dedicated collection of biological data. As such, the distribution of most cetacean species is still poorly understood. Ecological niche models are useful in studying species distributions and their ecological determinants, and platforms of opportunity (e.g. commercial nautical operators) can provide an alternative source for that data in cetaceans. In this study, we modelled common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) habitat preferences using ecological niche modelling and presence data obtained from distinct platforms of opportunity in two different areas in the Portuguese coast (west and south mainland Portugal) for the period 2005-2007. Models from southern Portugal were projected to western Portugal and vice-versa, to check for robustness in predicting the species ecological niche. Our results show that data from platforms of opportunity can result in robust ecological models and provide extremely useful information on cetacean ecology. We found that common dolphins exhibit a patchy distribution pattern over the Portuguese coastline, and identified key habitats for their occurrence. The most important variable associated with this species' distribution was chlorophyll concentration which, given the results from previous research, we hypothesise reflects an ecological specialisation on pelagic schooling fish. Given that the most abundant schooling fish species in Portugal is increasingly overexploited and in constant decline, more attention should be given to the conservation of common dolphin in Portuguese waters.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB Vocalizations of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in west Hong Kong waters were described from 12 recordings in 2010. A broadband hydrophone system recorded sounds. Vocalizations were characterized as broadband click trains, burst pulses, and narrowband frequency modulated sounds, including whistles generally similar to those of some other delphinid cetaceans. A comparison of results to previous humpback dolphin sound descriptions for Moreton Bay, Australia found broad similarities except for the apparent absence of "quacks" and "grunts" in the present study, which are of low frequency and thus were possibly masked by anthropogenic and other low frequency noise in the Hong Kong habitat.

TI Evaluating the utility of cox1 for cetacean species identification
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) gene has been promoted as a universal reference gene, or barcode, to identify organisms to the species level. We evaluated whether cox1 would be appropriate to diagnose cetacean species. The 5' end of cox1 (686 base pairs, bp) was sequenced for 46 of 86 recognized species of cetaceans. In addition, we included 105 sequences from GenBank, increasing our taxonomic coverage to 61 species. Particular focus was placed on sampling two subfamilies that contain closely related taxa: the Delphininae and the Globicephalinae. Species-specific sequences were observed for all but three taxa (Delphinus delphis, D. capensis, and Stenella coeruleoalba). Although correct assignment was seen for most species, significant overlap between intra- and interspecific variation makes cox1 an imperfect barcode for cetaceans. The efficacy of cox1 was compared to the 5' end of the cytochrome b (cytb) gene, a mitochondrial region routinely used for cetacean species identification. Although cytb performed better than cox1 for some species, this marker could not differentiate other closely related taxa (Eubalaena spp.). Species identification for taxa not reliably identified using cox1 or cytb might be best addressed through use of multiple mitochondrial DNA fragments or other newly developed markers.

TI Review of cetacean biopsy techniques: Factors contributing to successful
   sample collection and physiological and behavioral impacts
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Biopsy techniques have been developed to collect skin and blubber samples through non-lethal methods. One sample can provide data on genetics, prey preferences, foraging ecology, contaminant loads, and physiological processes. The limited data available suggest that biopsy wounds heal quickly and that there are usually no discernable adverse health effects. Published accounts on factors contributing to the success of collecting biopsy samples and the behavioral impacts to cetaceans following biopsy sampling were standardized to permit statistical analysis. Several factors contribute to the success of acquiring samples; however, sampling rates do not differ significantly between delivery devices. Behavioral responses to biopsy sampling vary by species and other factors. The most predominant response for odontocetes is low, while low and moderate responses are equally prevalent for mysticetes. The use of retrieval lines may increase the occurrence of moderate and strong responses by mysticetes. These findings suggest that biopsy sampling is relatively benign, causing only minor and short-lived responses. However, most researchers do not report sufficient data to assess short- and long-term physiological and behavioral impacts. Finally, limited data suggest that biopsy sampling does not impact cetacean habitat use or distribution patterns. Yet these impacts are rarely investigated, so additional data are needed.

TI Guiana Dolphins (Sotalia guianensis, Van Beneden 1864) as Indicators of
   the Bioaccumulation of Total Mercury along the Coast of Rio de Janeiro
   State, Southeastern Brazil
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Total mercury (Hg) was determined in muscle tissue of 20 Guiana dolphins stranded along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, with a mean of 1.07 mu g/g wet weight. Mercury concentrations were positively related to body length, possibly related to the capacity of the dolphins to bioaccumulate this element throughout life. The Hg concentrations were not significantly different between males and females, although females (1.08 mu g/g) showed slightly higher levels than males (1.04 mu g/g). Concentrations were low when compared to results of studies carried out with small cetaceans in the Northern Hemisphere, and with previous studies in the Southeastern Brazil.

TI MORBILLIVIRUS INFECTION IN LIVE STRANDED, INJURED, TRAPPED, AND CAPTIVE
   CETACEANS IN SOUTHEASTERN QUEENSLAND AND NORTHERN NEW SOUTH WALES,
   AUSTRALIA
SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB We report serologic evidence of cetacean morbillivirus (CMV) infection in five of eight cetacean species found live stranded, injured, or trapped along the coast of southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia between December 2005 and January 2011 Antibody to CMV was detected in 13 of 27 (48%) wild cetaceans sampled. Antibody prevalence was significantly higher in clinically diseased (69%) compared to nondiseased (18%) animals (P=0.018). There was high antibody prevalence (83%, n=6) in melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra). Two of 13 (15%) captive cetaceans sampled between November 2005 and January 2011. had CMV antibodies and, as infection was unlikely to have occurred while in captivity, CMV infection appears to have been present in Australian wild cetaceans since at least 1985. These results indicate that morbillivirus infection is occurring without widespread cetacean mortality in this region. However, as the deaths of two immature Australian offshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were attributed to CMV infection, morbillivirus infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of disease in cetaceans in Australia. Captive cetacean populations may be prone to significant mortality as a result of CMV introduction, so strict quarantine procedures should be enforced when injured or stranded cetaceans are hospitalized and rehabilitated at Australian zoos and marine parks.

TI Ecological characteristics contribute to sponge distribution and tool
   use in bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp.
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB In Shark Bay, Western Australia, bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp. carry conical sponges Echinodictyum mesenterinum on their rostra in the only documented cetacean foraging behaviour using a tool ('sponging'). In this study, we examined the influence of various ecological factors on live sponge distribution and the occurrence of sponging in parts of the western gulf of Shark Bay. We assessed sponge distribution and seagrass cover along 12 transects of approximately 11 km length, by recording sponges and seagrass in a total of 1380 quadrats (1 x 1 m), of which 56 quadrats contained conical sponges. The occurrence of sponging dolphins ('spongers') was documented along 10 of these 12 transects. The distribution of conical sponges was negatively correlated with the distribution of seagrass: no conical sponges were observed in water depths of <10 m and no seagrasses were found at depths of >12 m. A digital elevation model, created from the sample depth data, identified channels in the region. Binary logistic and Poisson log-linear generalised linear models showed that water depth and bathymetric features including channel, substrate and slope were significant in predicting the occurrence and the mean number of conical sponges, as well as that of seagrass. Conical sponge distribution was positively correlated with the distribution of sponging, indicating that ecological factors influence where sponging occurs. The greater number of spongers found in this region may be explained by the larger area of habitat suitable for conical sponges in the western than the eastern gulf of Shark Bay.

TI Active hunting by deep-diving sperm whales: 3D dive profiles and
   maneuvers during bursts of speed
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Active hunting pursuit can involve high expenditures of energy and therefore requires appropriately high-energy gains from successful prey capture. Using data loggers deployed on 12 sperm whales off the Ogasawara Islands, we regularly recorded bursts of speed during deep dives. Here, we analyzed speed, acceleration, and 3D data from these maneuvers to describe the whales' hunting behavior. Bursts occurred at depths >400 m. The median number of bursts was only 1 per dive (range: 0 to 6 per dive), and 33% of the dives did not include any bursts, suggesting prey capture may not always require bursts. Bursts of speed averaged 3.4 +/- 1.0 m s(-1) (mean +/- SD; maximum: 8 m s(-1)), more than twice the mean speed observed during dives (1.5 +/- 0.2 m s(-1)). Bursts were generally divided into two phases: (1) rapid acceleration with active stroking, and (2) drastic deceleration and changes in body orientation. Tagged whales swam up to 405 m (mean: 120 +/- 88 m) during these two phases. Such behavior suggests chasing of their prey, and should incur high energy expenditure. A large percentage (20 +/- 14%) of the drag-related locomotion cost of the dives was spent in bursts. Two major types of bursts were observed: inflectional bursts with turning (87%) and linear bursts without turning (13%). Our results strongly indicate that sperm whales use an active-pursuit hunting strategy and use the bursts only to catch powerful and nutritious prey (i.e. large and/or muscular) that compensate for the energetic cost of the burst.

TI Population Genetic Structure and Social Kin Associations of Franciscana
   Dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei
SO JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
AB We investigated population and social structure of the franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei, an endemic and the most endangered cetacean of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We analyzed samples from the Rio de la Plata estuary obtained in Uruguayan waters and from the Atlantic Ocean obtained in both Uruguayan and Brazilian waters. Mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers were used to study differentiation between the estuary and the ocean and the association between kinship and social group structure. Although multilocus analyses suggested that franciscanas are structured into 2 subpopulations (K = 2, divergence among clusters: F-ST = 0.06, P = 0.002; R-ST = 0.3, P = 0.001), mitochondrial markers did not support such divergence (F-ST = 0.02, P = 0.12; (ST) = 0.06, P =0.06). However, these units are not entirely segregated geographically. Regarding social structure, some groups are composed by first-order related individuals (R >= 0.5, P < 0.5). Overall, the data suggest that matrilines could be the social unit in this species. We argue that the divergence found could be associated to local adaptation and social structure, resulting from either feature leading to a recent divergence or reflecting equilibrium between local differentiation and gene flow. This evidence supports considering franciscanas from the Rio de la Plata estuary a discrete management unit.

TI Tagging young humpback whale calves: methodology and diving behavior
SO ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH
AB Despite the importance of young animals to the proliferation of a species, logistic hurdles often prevent the study of individuals' behavior and habitat requirements. This is particularly an issue in the case of cetaceans, which spend a large proportion of their time at depth. We conducted a study to describe the dive behavior of young humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae calves on their breeding grounds in Hawaii, USA. We first implemented and evaluated strategies for approaching whale groups and deploying suction-cup tags (DTAGs), resulting in 3 successful attachments of DTAGs in the winter of 2011. The approach technique that was most successful while minimizing reactions from the whale groups was a passive drift approach. Tagged calves exhibited consistent dives to shallow depths when their groups were stationary, and some deeper dives that approached the ocean bottom, up to 78 m in one case. Mean dive durations ranged from 2.2 to 3.5 min, with calves spending 40% of their time within 3 m of the surface. This is the first study to collect tag data from baleen whale calves less than 6 mo in age and provides habitat use data important for management of this endangered species.

TI Uncertain status of the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus:
   population fragmentation, legacy of whaling and current threats
SO ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH
AB The northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus is the best-known beaked whale species, but its conservation status remains very uncertain. A medium-sized cetacean that lives in the deeper waters of the northern North Atlantic, it is remarkable for its deep dives and inquisitiveness towards ships. There seem to have been of the order of 100 000 whales prior to 40 yr of intense whaling beginning in the 1880s, and this population was undoubtedly heavily reduced by 1920. The effects of a second phase of whaling between 1937 and 1973 are contentious, and current abundance estimates are patchy. There are suggestions of metapopulation structure (even at the scale of 50 km) in the western Atlantic among populations that do not appear to migrate. In the eastern Atlantic, data on population structure and migrations are few and confusing. Whales are incidentally caught in fishing gear and interact with fisheries off Labrador, Canada. They may also be affected by underwater noise. However, the population consequences of these and other anthropogenic stressors, particularly within this unknown metapopulation structure, are very uncertain. In some respects, such as the paucity of sightings on major whaling grounds off mainland Norway and Labrador, the picture that we have is disturbing. Analyses of genes, contaminants and vocalizations, as well as photoidentification and satellite tag data, can inform about population structure, migrations, life history parameters, current population sizes, and threats.

TI Decompression vs. decomposition: distribution, amount and gas
   composition of bubbles in stranded marine mammals
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Gas embolic lesions linked to military sonar have been described in stranded cetaceans including beaked whales. These descriptions suggest that gas bubbles in marine mammal tissues may be more common than previously thought. In this study we have analyzed gas amount (by gas score) and gas composition within different decomposition codes using a standardized methodology. This broad study has allowed us to explore species-specific variability in bubble prevalence, amount, distribution, and composition, as well as masking of bubble content by putrefaction gases. Bubbles detected within the cardiovascular system and other tissues related to both pre- and port-mortem processes are a common finding on necropsy of stranded cetaceans. To minimize masking by putrefaction gases, necropsy, and gas sampling must be performed as soon as possible. Before 24h post mortem is recommended but preferably within 12 h post mortem. At necropsy, amount of bubbles (gas score) in decomposition code 2 in stranded cetaceans was found to be more important than merely presence vs. absence of bubbles from a pathological point of view. Deep divers presented higher abundance of gas bubbles, mainly composed of 70% nitrogen and 30% CO2, suggesting a higher predisposition of these species to suffer from decompression-related gas embolism.

TI Vascularization of air sinuses and fat bodies in the head of the
   Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus): morphological mplications on
   physiology
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cetaceans have long been considered capable of limiting diving-induced nitrogen absorption and subsequent decompression sickness through a series of behavioral, anatomical, and physiological adaptations. Recent studies however suggest that in some situations these adaptive mechanisms might be overcome, resulting in lethal and sublethal injuries. Perhaps most relevant to this discussion is the finding of intravascular gas and fat emboli in mass-stranded beaked whales. Although the source of the gas emboli has as yet to been ascertained, preliminary findings suggest nitrogen is the primary component. Since nitrogen gas embolus formation in divers is linked to nitrogen saturation, it seems premature to dismiss similar pathogenic mechanisms in breath-hold diving cetaceans. Due to the various anatomical adaptations in cetacean lungs, the pulmonary system is thought of as an unlikely site of significant nitrogen absorption. The accessory sinus system on the ventral head of odontocete cetaceans contains a sizeable volume of air that is exposed to the changing hydrostatic pressures during a dive, and is intimately associated with vasculature potentially capable of absorbing nitrogen through its walls. The source of the fat emboli has also remained elusive. Most mammalian fat deposits are considered poorly vascularized and therefore unlikely sites of intravascular introduction of lipid, although cetacean blubber may not be as poorly vascularized as previously thought. We present new data on the vasculature of air sinuses and acoustic fat bodies in the head of bottlenose dolphins and compare it to published accounts. We show that the mandibular fat bodies and accessory sinus system are associated with extensive venous plexuses and suggest potential physiological and pathological implications.

TI Estimated tissue and blood N-2 levels and risk of decompression sickness
   in deep-, intermediate-, and shallow-diving toothed whales during
   exposure to naval sonar
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Naval sonar has been accused of causing whale stranding by a mechanism which increases formation of tissue N-2 gas bubbles. Increased tissue and blood N-2 levels, and thereby increased risk of decompression sickness (DCS), is thought to result from changes in behavior or physiological responses during diving. Previous theoretical studies have used hypothetical sonar-induced changes in both behavior and physiology to model blood and tissue N-2 tension (P-N2), but this is the first attempt to estimate the changes during actual behavioral responses to sonar. We used an existing mathematical model to estimate blood and tissue N-2 tension (P-N2) from dive data recorded from sperm, killer, long-finned pilot, Blainville's beaked, and Cuvier's beaked whales before and during exposure to Low- (1-2 kHz) and Mid- (2-7 kHz) frequency active sonar. Our objectives were: (1) to determine if differences in dive behavior affects risk of bubble formation, and if (2) behavioral-or (3) physiological responses to sonar are plausible risk factors. Our results suggest that all species have natural high N-2 levels, with deep diving generally resulting in higher end-dive P-N2 as compared with shallow diving. Sonar exposure caused some changes in dive behavior in both killer whales, pilot whales and beaked whales, but this did not lead to any increased risk of DCS. However, in three of eight exposure session with sperm whales, the animal changed to shallower diving, and in all these cases this seem to result in an increased risk of DCS, although risk was still within the normal risk range of this species. When a hypothetical removal of the normal dive response (bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction), was added to the behavioral response during model simulations, this led to an increased variance in the estimated end-dive N-2 levels, but no consistent change of risk. In conclusion, we cannot rule out the possibility that a combination of behavioral and physiological responses to sonar have the potential to alter the blood and tissue end-dive N-2 tension to levels which could cause DCS and formation of in vivo bubbles, but the actually observed behavioral responses of cetaceans to sonar in our study, do not imply any significantly increased risk of DCS.

TI Neuroimmunological response of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) to
   translocation and a novel social environment
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB This study assessed changes in phagocyte function and activation of the sympatho-adrenal medullary and hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axes of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) in response to translocation and introduction to a novel social environment. Transported belugas exhibited increases in epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and cortisol levels in response to the translocation process. In response to the introduction of the transported belugas, resident belugas exhibited an increase in E and NE but not cortisol. Moreover, the increase in E and NE shown by the transported belugas was significantly greater than the increase exhibited by the resident belugas. Resident belugas exhibited a concomitant decrease in neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis associated with the introduction of the transported belugas. In contrast, transported belugas exhibited an attendant increase in phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity immediately following transport. Differences in phagocyte response may derive from differences in hormonal milieu, stressor modality and/or intensity, or phagocyte priming. Investigating the complex interactions between types of stressors, neuroendocrine response, and immunocompetence will lead to a better understanding of the impacts of environmental challenges, including anthropogenic perturbations, on the health of cetacean populations.

TI Do Porpoises Choose Their Associates? A New Method for Analyzing Social
   Relationships among Cetaceans
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Observing and monitoring the underwater social interactions of cetaceans is challenging. Therefore, previous cetacean studies have monitored these interactions by surface observations. However, because cetaceans spend most of their time underwater, it is important that their underwater behavior is also continuously monitored to better understand their social relationships and social structure. The finless porpoise is small and has no dorsal fin. It is difficult to observe this species in the wild, and little is known of its sociality.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The swim depths of 6 free-ranging finless porpoises were simultaneously recorded using a time-synchronized bio-logging system. Synchronous diving was used as an index of association. Two pairs, # 27 (an immature female estimated to be 3.5 years old) and # 32 (an adult male), # 28 (a juvenile male estimated to be 2 years old) and # 29 (an adult male), tended to participate in long periods of synchronized diving more frequently than 13 other possible pairs, indicating that the 4 porpoises chose their social partners. The adult males (# 32, # 29) tended to follow the immature female (# 27) and juvenile male (# 28), respectively. However, during synchronized diving, the role of an initiator often changed within the pair, and their body movements appeared to be non-agonistic, e. g., rubbing of bodies against one another instead of that on one-side, as observed with chasing and escaping behaviors.
   Conclusions/Significance: The present study employed a time-synchronized bio-logging method to observe the social relationships of free-ranging aquatic animals based on swimming depth. The results suggest that certain individuals form associations even if they are not a mother and calf pair. Long synchronized dives occurred when particular members were reunited, and this suggests that the synchronized dives were not a by-product of opportunistic aggregation.

AB Phagocytic and respiratory burst activity was simultaneously measured by flow cytometry in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes in whole blood from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Blood was collected from 16 adult dolphins, 12 males (6-34 years of age) and 4 females (11-30 years) and subsequently incubated with a bacteria-to-leukocyte ratio of 25:1 and 10 mu l of 500 mu M 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate for 70 min at 37 degrees C. PMN (44.5 +/- 3.2%) and monocytes (33.5 +/- 3.0%) were positive for propidium iodide-labeled Staphylococcus aureus, indicating phagocytosis. Respiratory burst activity after 70 min as measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 68.0 +/- 14.4 in PMN and 47.0 +/- 10.3 in monocytes. There were no significant differences in MFI or percentage of phagocytizing PMN (p>0.094) or monocytes (p>0.275) after storage at 4 degrees C for 24 h when compared to activity measured in fresh blood. Nor was there an effect of storage on respiratory burst activity (MFI or percentage) in PMN (p>0.420) or monocytes (p>0.301). This assay may be particularly useful to assess the ability of dolphins to effectively combat bacterial pathogen challenges with minimal amounts of blood. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Parasites of cetaceans stranded on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB Information regarding parasitic fauna of cetaceans from Costa Rica is provided for the first time. A total of 25 stranded dolphins and whales were examined between 2001 and 2009, including striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) (n = 19), pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata) (n = 2), spinner dolphin (S. longirostris)(n = 1), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (n = 1), dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) (n = 1) and Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) (n = 1). Pathological findings associated with the parasites are also presented. In the most representative dolphin species, S. coeruleoalba, the prevalence of parasites was 89.5%; moreover, all examined specimens of S. attenuata, S. longirostris, T. truncatus and Z. cavirostris presented parasites. No parasites were recovered from K. sima. Fourteen helminth taxa were identified, including six species of cestodes (Strobilocephalus triangularis, Tetrabothrius forsteri, Trigonocotyle sp., Phyllobothrium delphini, Monorygma grimaldi, Tetraphyllidea gen. sp. plerocercoid), four digeneans (Nasitrema globicephalae, Brachycladium palliatum, B. pacificum and Oschmarinella albamarina) and four nematodes (Anisakis spp., Halocercus lagenorhynchi,Halocercus sp. and Crassicauda anthonyi). A commensal crustacean, Xenobalanus globicipitis, was also identified. All identified parasites representing new geographic records for the Pacific coast of Central America and new host records are presented. Parasitological information is valuable for conservation of cetaceans in Pacific coast of Costa Rica. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Methodology for in situ gas sampling, transport and laboratory analysis
   of gases from stranded cetaceans
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Gas-bubble lesions were described in cetaceans stranded in spatio-temporal concordance with naval exercises using high-powered sonars. A behaviourally induced decompression sickness-like disease was proposed as a plausible causal mechanism, although these findings remain scientifically controversial. Investigations into the constituents of the gas bubbles in suspected gas embolism cases are highly desirable. We have found that vacuum tubes, insulin syringes and an aspirometer are reliable tools for in situ gas sampling, storage and transportation without appreciable loss of gas and without compromising the accuracy of the analysis. Gas analysis is conducted by gas chromatography in the laboratory. This methodology was successfully applied to a mass stranding of sperm whales, to a beaked whale stranded in spatial and temporal association with military exercises and to a cetacean chronic gas embolism case. Results from the freshest animals confirmed that bubbles were relatively free of gases associated with putrefaction and consisted predominantly of nitrogen.

TI Phylogenetic Status and Timescale for the Diversification of Steno and
   Sotalia Dolphins
SO PLOS ONE
AB Molecular data have provided many insights into cetacean evolution but some unsettled issues still remain. We estimated the topology and timing of cetacean evolutionary relationships using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes. In order to clarify the phylogenetic placement of Sotalia and Steno within the Delphinidae, we sequenced three new delphinid mitogenomes. Our analyses support three delphinid clades: one joining Steno and Sotalia (supporting the revised subfamily Stenoninae); another placing Sousa within the Delphininae; and a third, the Globicephalinae, which includes Globicephala, Feresa, Pseudorca, Peponocephala and Grampus. We also conclude that Orcinus does not belong in the Globicephalinae, but Orcaella may be part of that subfamily. Divergence dates were estimated using the relaxed molecular clock calibrated with fossil data. We hypothesise that the timing of separation of the marine and Amazonian Sotalia species (2.3 Ma) coincided with the establishment of the modern Amazon River basin.

TI The high fidelity of the cetacean stranding record: insights into
   measuring diversity by integrating taphonomy and macroecology
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Stranded cetaceans have long intrigued naturalists because their causation has escaped singular explanations. Regardless of cause, strandings also represent a sample of the living community, although their fidelity has rarely been quantified. Using commensurate stranding and sighting records compiled from archived datasets representing nearly every major ocean basin, I demonstrated that the cetacean stranding record faithfully reflects patterns of richness and relative abundance in living communities, especially for coastlines greater than 2000 km and latitudinal gradients greater than 4 degrees. Live-dead fidelity metrics from seven different countries indicated that strandings were almost always richer than live surveys; richness also increased with coastline length. Most death assemblages recorded the same ranked relative abundance as living communities, although this correlation decreased in strength and significance at coastline lengths greater than 15 000 km, highlighting the importance of sampling diversity at regional scales. Rarefaction analyses indicated that sampling greater than 10 years generally enhanced the completeness of death assemblages, although protracted temporal sampling did not substitute for sampling over longer coastlines or broader latitudes. Overall, this global live-dead comparison demonstrated that strandings almost always provided better diversity information about extant cetacean communities than live surveys; such archives are therefore relevant for macroecological and palaeobiological studies of cetacean community change through time.

TI Clinicoimmunopathologic findings in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins
   Tursiops truncatus with positive cetacean morbillivirus antibody titers
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB Sera from free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida were tested for antibodies to cetacean morbilliviruses from 2003 to 2007 as part of a multidisciplinary study of individual and population health. A suite of clinico immunopathologic variables were evaluated in morbillivirus-seropositive dolphins (n = 14) and seronegative healthy dolphins (n = 49). Several important differences were found. Serum alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, chloride, albumin and albumin/globulin ratios were significantly lower in seropositive dolphins. Innate immunity appeared to be upregulated with significant increases in lysozyme concentration and marginally significant increases in monocytic phagocytosis. Adaptive immunity was also impacted in dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers. Mitogen-induced T lymphocyte proliferation responses were significantly reduced in dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers, and marginally significant decreases were found for absolute numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes. The findings suggest impairment of cell-mediated adaptive immunity, similar to the immunologic pattern reported with acute morbillivirus infection in other species. In contrast, dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers appeared to have at least a partially upregulated humoral immune response with significantly higher levels of gamma globulins than healthy dolphins, which may represent an antibody response to morbillivirus infection or other pathogens. These data suggest that subclinical dolphin morbillivirus infection in IRL dolphins may produce clinicoimmunopathologic perturbations that impact overall health.

SO REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA MARINA Y OCEANOGRAFIA
AB We review the records of published and unpublished sightings and strandings for Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) in subantarctic waters of the Southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. Based on 59 sighting (n = 521 individuals) and 33 stranding records (n = 88 individuals), we identified three main areas of Risso's dolphin concentration in Patagonian waters, which have been observed mostly during the austral summer. We were unable to find published or unpublished reports of Risso's dolphin in offshore or over deep-water areas in this region. Future studies covering other potential areas of the species' distribution are important to improve the scarce information known for this dolphin in this area.

TI Reconstructing Body Size in Extinct Crown Cetacea (Neoceti) Using
   Allometry, Phylogenetic Methods and Tests from the Fossil Record
SO JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION
AB Living cetaceans exhibit interspecific size ranging across several orders of magnitude, and rank among the largest vertebrates ever. Details of how cetaceans evolved different body sizes, however, remain obscure, because they lack basic morphological proxies that have been traditionally used in other fossil vertebrates. Here, we reconstruct the body size of extinct crown group cetaceans (Neoceti) using different regression methods on extant skull and length data, in a phylogenetic context. Because most fossil cetaceans are fragmentary, we developed regression equations to predict total length based on cranial metrics that are preserved on most fossil crania. The resultant regression equations are based on a database of skull and length data from most extant lineages of cetaceans (n=45 species; 272 specimens), sampling all living mysticete genera and all major clades of odontocetes. In generating predictive equations, we compared both conventional species data regression and independent contrast regression methods, as well as single trait predictors and a new approach that combines the advantages of a partial least squares (PLS) multivariate regression with independent contrasts. This last approach leverages the predictive power of using multiple correlated proxies. Lastly, we used the rare occurrences of fossil cetaceans with preserved total lengths to test the performance of our predictive equations for reconstructing body size from skull measurements alone. Our results demonstrate that incorporating information about phylogenetic relationships and multiple cranial measures in PLS scaling studies increases the accuracy of reconstructed body size, most notably by reducing prediction intervals by more than 70%. With this empirical foundation, we highlight the outline of major features in the evolution of body size for Neoceti and future opportunities to use these metrics for paleobiological questions.

TI Acoustic monitoring of habitat use by bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful
   Sound, New Zealand
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Passive acoustic methods are increasingly used to study cetacean habitat use and behaviour. The Timing Porpoise Detector (T-POD; www.chelonia.co.uk) is a self-contained acoustic data logger, which records echolocation by cetaceans. This study used nine T-PODs to document habitat use by bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, over a 12-month period, collecting data over 76,104 h (of a possible 78,840). T-POD records show that dolphin distribution varied seasonally, with inner fiord sites being used most often in summer and autumn, and outer fiord sites during winter and spring. This seasonal pattern was positively correlated with surface water temperature. Echolocation activity in general and buzzes, which are usually indicative of foraging, were both significantly more common during dawn and/or dusk, suggesting crepuscular foraging. T-POD data suggest that parts of the 'Dolphin Protection Zone`, in which boat traffic is restricted, are used frequently while other parts are not, and provide a basis for refining this management tool.

TI The global extent and character of marine mammal consumption by humans:
   1970-2009
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB The killing and consumption of marine mammals fuels tense global struggles between advocates of sustainable use and advocates of complete protection for these animals. However, reporting on the extent and character of marine mammal consumption by people is uneven and often anecdotal. We developed a consistent approach to summarize information from approximately 900 sources. It is now clear that human consumption of marine mammals is geographically widespread, taxonomically diverse, and often of uncertain sustainability. Since 1990, people in at least 114 countries have consumed one or more of at least 87 marine mammal species. Although changing social, ecological, or political circumstances are leading to reduced killing and consumption of marine mammals in some regions, in other regions the prevailing socio-economic conditions and new technologies are leading to increased killing and consumption, particularly of small cetaceans. Consumption of marine mammals is considered a significant aspect of food security and cultural well being in many regions, and provides some economic (including cash) benefits to people in at least 54 countries. Our review highlights an escalation in utilization of small cetaceans caught in conjunction with fishing activities since 1970, a form of fishing-up-the-food-chain. Where consumption relates to food security and poverty, we found evidence of deliberate killing of animals caught both deliberately and accidentally in fishing gear. Constraints on government agencies responsible for implementing regulations, often due to the geographic remoteness of catches, mean that greater understanding is needed of the motivations that underlie consumption of marine mammals so that more effective conservation measures can be designed and implemented.

TI A threatened beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population in the traffic
   lane: Vessel-generated noise characteristics of the Saguenay-St.
   Lawrence Marine Park, Canada
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB The threatened resident beluga population of the St. Lawrence Estuary shares the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park with significant anthropogenic noise sources, including marine commercial traffic and a well-established, vessel-based whale-watching industry. Frequency-dependent (FD) weighting was used to approximate beluga hearing sensitivity to determine how noise exposure varied in time and space at six sites of high beluga summer residency. The relative contribution of each source to acoustic habitat degradation was estimated by measuring noise levels throughout the summer and noise signatures of typical vessel classes with respect to traffic volume and sound propagation characteristics. Rigid-hulled inflatable boats were the dominant noise source with respect to estimated beluga hearing sensitivity in the studied habitats due to their high occurrence and proximity, high correlation with site-specific FD-weighted sound levels, and the dominance of mid-frequencies (0.3-23 kHz) in their noise signatures. Median C-weighted sound pressure level (SPLRMS) had a range of 19 dB re 1 mu Pa between the noisiest and quietest sites. Broadband SPLRMS] exceeded 120 dB re 1 mu Pa 8-32% of the time depending on the site. Impacts of these noise levels on St. Lawrence beluga will depend on exposure recurrence and individual responsiveness. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3658449]

TI PBDEs in the blubber of marine mammals from coastal areas of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, southwestern Atlantic
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Limited information is available in the literature on the levels of brominated flame retardants in the southern hemisphere. This study presents concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the blubber of small cetaceans from the coast of So Paulo (Brazil), southwestern Atlantic. PBDE levels were highest in Stenella frontalis (770 ng g(-1) lipid) followed by Steno bredanensis (475 ng g(-1) lipid), Sotalia guianensis (65.6 ng g(-1) lipid). Tursiops truncatus (64.2 ng g(-1) lipid) and Pontoporia blainvillei (60.3 ng g(-1) lipid). In general, continental shelf individuals exhibited higher contamination than inshore animals. This might be related to larger prey items consumed by continental shelf dolphins. The pattern of contamination indicates that Penta-BDE commercial mixtures are a major source of PBDEs to top predators in the southwestern Atlantic. Congeners found in Octa-BDE formulations were not detected in the investigated animals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Management of Antarctic baleen whales amid past exploitation, current
   threats and complex marine ecosystems
SO ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
AB As baleen whales recover from severe exploitation, they are probably subject to a wide variety of threats within the Antarctic marine ecosystem, including directed take. Here we review both the management and current status of Antarctic baleen whales and consider those threats likely to impact on them. Threats range from global problems - marine pollution and climate change - to localized issues including shipping, habitat disturbance, unregulated wildlife tourism and fishery activities. We identify the most pressing anthropogenic threats to baleen whales including scientific whaling and climate change. It is unclear whether current management approaches will be able to effectively encompass all these threats while also accounting both for the differing levels of scientific understanding and for the differing recovery rates of the whale species. For management we recommend the following: 1) incorporation of both ecosystem considerations and the suite of identified threats not limited to direct take, 2) identification of measurable indicators of changes in whales that allow more certainty in monitoring of populations and the environment, and 3) recognition of significant relationships between baleen whales and habitat features to provide information on distribution and use.

TI Cetacean By-Catch in the Korean Peninsula-by Chance or by Design?
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB Whaling remains one of the most contentious issues in global conservation. In South Korea, where commercial and subsistence whaling are both illegal, domestic sales of cetacean products such as skin, blubber and red meat are allowed if they are accidently caught. However, environmental groups have claimed that the high price of meat may be acting as an incentive for illegal hunting and 'deliberate by-catch' where whales are intentionally killed or left to die by fishermen when they become trapped in their nets. In this paper we investigate the issue of deliberate by-catch and illegal hunting of the protected Minke J-stock population in Korean waters using grounded theory, an approach that allows theories and understanding to emerge from the analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. Our research suggests that deliberate by-catch is almost certainly taking place but that illegal hunting and/or illegal importation from Japan may be far more significant sources of Minke whale meat. We discuss possible measures to reduce incentives for deliberate by-catch and illegal hunting such as the introduction of mandatory reporting of quantities supplied and consumed in restaurants and a tax on meat sales at auction. More generally, our research illustrates how the analysis of price movements can shed light on the scale of illegal wildlife trade and how a combination of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies can provide understanding of a complex, multifaceted conservation issue.

TI Genetic comparison among dolphin morbillivirus in the 1990-1992 and
   2006-2008 Mediterranean outbreaks
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB In 1990, dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) killed thousands of striped dolphins in the Mediterranean. Subsequently, the prevalence of the infection declined in this species. In 2006-2008, the virus killed not only numerous striped dolphins but also long-finned pilot whales. All partial sequences of the phosphoprotein and nucleoprotein genes obtained thus far from different host species during the 2006-2008 outbreak show 100% identity, suggesting that a single virus was involved, and these sequences are nearly identical to the 1990 Spanish strain. Here our first objective was to determine the sequence identity between the morbillivirus from the 2006-2008 outbreak and the 1990 Spanish strain by sequencing more extensive genomic regions of strains from one pilot whale and one striped dolphin stranded in 2007. The second objective was to investigate the relationship between the 1990 and 2007 strains by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the phosphoprotein gene to compare several Cetacean morbilliviruses, and another tree based on the nearly complete genomes of Mediterranean DMV. The third objective was to identify the most variable regions in the DMV genomes.
   Results showed that the two 2007 Spanish strains were 99.9% identical over 9050 bp and should be considered the same virus, and that this virus is 99.3-99.4% similar to the 1990 Spanish strain. The phylogenetic trees, together with the common geographical area for the two outbreaks, suggest that the 2007 DMV strains evolved from the 1990 DMV strain. Pilot whales do not seem to have been exposed or infected during the 1990-1992 epidemic, since these populations appeared to be immunologically naive in 2006-2008. Our results suggest that the virus may have evolved in striped dolphin populations prior to the 2006-2008 outbreak, after which it entered the long-finned pilot whale, perhaps aided by an alanine to valine mutation in the N-terminal domain of the fusion protein.

TI Distribution and home range of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)
   off Veracruz, Mexico
SO CIENCIAS MARINAS
AB With the goal of gathering ecological data to develop future cetacean management and conservation plans, the distribution, home range, and residency of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were studied in the central-north Mexican Gulf of Mexico. Between July 2005 and June 2008, 59 boat surveys were carried out for a total of 313 h of effort at sea. During these surveys, 471 individuals were observed in 88 different groups. Photographs of naturally marked animals resulted in 275 different individuals photo-identified. Their distribution was homogeneous throughout the study area at a mean distance from the coast of 2.5 km (SD = 2.9, n = 471) and depths less than 20 m. Of the total of dolphins identified, 202 (73%) had a low sighting rate and were considered transients, whereas 34 individuals (12%) had medium and high sighting rates and were considered resident animals. At the population level, home range estimates calculated using the minimum convex polygon method showed a mean of 2771 +/- 1116 km(2). Using the adaptive kernel method, the mean size of home range was 1199 +/- 143 km2, with five core areas identified. These areas decreased in size during the rainy season because dolphins remained close to the river plumes. At individual level, the mean home range was 129.2 km(2) (n = 66), concurring with other reports from the Gulf of Mexico (Texas and Florida) in spite of habitat differences. The main component determining the size of the home range was the presence of rivers, rather than the geomorphology of the coast.

TI Auditory temporal resolution and evoked responses to pulsed sounds for
   the Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis)
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND
   BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB Temporal cues are important for some forms of auditory processing, such as echolocation. Among odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises), it has been suggested that porpoises may have temporal processing abilities which differ from other odontocetes because of their relatively narrow auditory filters and longer duration echolocation signals. This study examined auditory temporal resolution in two Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) to measure: (a) rate following responses and modulation rate transfer function for 100 kHz centered pulse sounds and (b) hearing thresholds and response amplitudes generated by individual pulses of different durations. The animals followed pulses well at modulation rates up to 1,250 Hz, after which response amplitudes declined until extinguished beyond 2,500 Hz. The subjects had significantly better hearing thresholds for longer, narrower-band pulses similar to porpoise echolocation signals compared to brief, broadband sounds resembling dolphin clicks. Results indicate that the Yangtze finless porpoise follows individual acoustic signals at rates similar to other odontocetes tested. Relatively good sensitivity for longer duration, narrow-band signals suggests that finless porpoise hearing is well suited to detect their unique echolocation signals.

TI Pregnancy is a drag: hydrodynamics, kinematics and performance in pre-
   and post-parturition bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Constraints on locomotion could be an important component of the cost of reproduction as carrying an increased load associated with eggs or developing fetuses may contribute to decreased locomotor performance for females across taxa and environments. Diminished performance could increase susceptibility to predation, yet the mechanism(s) by which gravidity and pregnancy affect locomotion remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics were altered during pregnancy, providing a mechanism for diminished locomotor performance in two near-term pregnant (10 days pre-parturition) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Near-term pregnancy resulted in a 51 +/- 14% increase in frontal surface area, coinciding with dramatic increases in drag forces while gliding. For example, pregnant females encountered 80 N of drag at 1.7 m s(-1) whereas that magnitude of drag was not encountered until speed doubled for females 18 months post-parturition. Indeed, drag coefficients based on frontal surface area were significantly greater during pregnancy (C(d,F)=0.22 +/- 0.04) than at 18 months post-parturition (C(d,F)=0.09 +/- 0.01). Pregnancy also induced a gait change as stroke amplitude and distance per stroke were reduced by 13 and 14%, respectively, compared with non-pregnant periods (1-24 months post-parturition). This was concomitant with a 62 and 44% reduction in mean and maximum swim speeds, respectively, during the pregnancy period. Interestingly, attack speeds of known predators of dolphins surpass maximum speeds for the pregnant dolphins in this study. Thus, pregnant dolphins may be more susceptible to predation. This study demonstrates unequivocally that changes in morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics are associated with diminished performance during pregnancy in dolphins.

TI Postural instability and akinesia in a pantropical spotted dolphin,
   Stenella attenuata, in proximity to operating airguns of a geophysical
   seismic vessel
SO JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB Aberrant behaviour including erratic locomotion was observed in a pantropical spotted dolphin 600 m ahead of an airgun array during 3D seismic explorations off Liberia in March 2009. The dolphin, presumably in acoustic distress, lifted its head and cervical region above the surface in an oblique, strikingly rigid posture during 5 min. Turbulent white-water evidenced a major propulsory thrust. Incremental postural instability and apparent exhaustion progressed to a catatonic-like state of akinesia as the dolphin rolled over onto one side, then its back before sinking virtually motionless close to the airgun array. Unless it recovered full locomotory control, asphyxiation was inevitable. Potential internal injury is discussed, both acoustic-mediated and from extreme exertion (exertional myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric nephrosis). As behaviour was spatially and temporally closely associated with firing seismic airguns, we suggest a cause-effect relationship. Differential diagnoses of pre-existing morbidity, senescence, or intoxication are considered possible but unlikely. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Anthropogenic and naturally occurring polybrominated phenolic compounds
   in the blood of cetaceans stranded along Japanese coastal waters
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB We determined the residue levels and patterns of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs), and related compounds, such as PBDEs, methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs), and bromophenols (BPhs) in the blood of eleven cetacean species stranded along the Japanese coasts. The dominant OH- and MeO-PBDE isomers found in all cetaceans were 6OH-BDE47 and 6MeO-BDE47. Additionally, 2,4,6-triBPh was dominant isomer in all cetaceans. In contrast, specific differences in the distribution of para- and meta- OH-PBDE isomers and some BPhs (potential PBDEs metabolites) were found among the cetaceans.
   Residue levels of Sigma MeO-PBDEs and 6OH-BDE47 + 2'OH-BDE68, and 2,4,6-triBPh and 6OH-BDE47 + 2'OH-BDE68 showed a significant positive correlation. These results may suggest that the large percentages of OH-PBDEs, MeO-PBDEs and 2,4,6-triBPh might share common source (i.e. biosynthesis by marine organisms), or metabolic pathway in cetacean species. Significant correlations were found between the concentrations of BDE99 and 2,4,5-triBPh. This result suggested that 2,4,5-triBPh in cetaceans could be a metabolite of BDE99. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Systematics, biostratigraphy and evolutionary pattern of the
   Oligo-Miocene marine mammals from the Maltese Islands
SO GEOBIOS
AB An overview of the upper Oligocene-upper Miocene marine sediments outcropping in the Maltese Islands provides a detailed stratigraphical setting of several marine mammal assemblages. The studied fossil material collected within the entire sequence, is now kept in the National Museum of Natural History of Mdina (Malta). Nannoplankton analysis of some selected sections, where mammal remains have been discovered, is also undertaken. The fossil marine mammals, consisting mostly of isolated ear bones and teeth, are referred to cetaceans (both mysticetes and odontocetes), sirenians, and pinnipeds. The cetacean record evidences an evolutionary pattern that agrees with the Oligo-Miocene general trend, characterized by the progressive rarefaction and disappearance of archaic families (squalodontids, waipatiids, and, maybe, mammalodontids), and by the appearance and diversification of the extant families represented within younger strata (kogiids, pontoporiids and ziphiids). Pontoporiids, waipatiids, and tentatively mammalodontids are here reported for the first time in the Mediterranean, while the kogiid record represents the only sure Miocene evidence of this family in the Mediterranean. The geographical distribution of the mammalodontids and the waipatiids, based on the Maltese and extra-Mediterranean records, supports an open communication between the Proto-Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific during the late Oligocene. Sirenians are represented by several dugongid pachyosteosclerotic rib fragments, collected from upper Oligocene through upper Miocene sediments. Pinnipeds are represented by a femur fragment from the Serravallian, referred to an indeterminate monachine, a phocid subfamily already reported from the Mio-Pliocene of the Mediterranean.

TI Ecotoxicological diagnosis of striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba)
   from the Mediterranean basin by skin biopsy and gene expression approach
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB Mediterranean cetacean odontocetes are exposed to environmental stress, in particular to persistent organic pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace elements. In the present study, the response of "gene-expression biomarkers" was evaluated in Mediterranean striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) skin biopsies collected in three sampling areas: Pelagos sanctuary (Ligurian sea), Ionian sea, and Strait of Gibraltar. The mRNA levels of five putative biomarker genes (aryl hydrocarbon receptor, E2F-1 transcription factor, cytochrome P450 1A, estrogen receptor 1, and heat shock protein 70) were measured for the first time by quantitative real-time PCR in cetacean skin biopsies. The different responses of most of the genes reflected contamination levels in the three sampling areas. Pelagos sanctuary dolphins appeared to be the most exposed to toxicological stress, having the highest up-regulation of CYP1A and AHR. Moreover, a cluster analysis distinguished the populations on the basis of the gene expression biomarker used in our study, showing different pattern between Mediterranean sea and Strait of Gibraltar. Our results suggest that this molecular approach applied to non-destructive biopsy material is a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating ecotoxicological impact on cetacean populations.

TI Similarities in echolocation strategy and click characteristics between
   a Pseudorca crassidens and a Tursiops truncatus
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB A previous comparative analysis of normalized click amplitude spectra from a Tursiops truncatus has shown that those frequencies with the lowest click-to-click variability in spectral content were the frequencies the animal paid attention to during target discrimination tasks. In that case, the dolphin only paid attention to the frequency range between 29-42 kHz which had a significantly higher degree of consistency in spectral content than frequencies above 42 kHz. Here it is shown that despite their morphological and behavioral differences, this same pattern of consistency was used by a Pseudorca crassidens performing a similar discrimination task. This comparison between species provides a foundation for using spectral level variability to determine the frequencies most important for echolocation in rare species and non-captive animals. Such results provide key information for successful management. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3621716]

Sounds included echolocation clicks and burst pulses. Echolocation clicks were grouped into three categories, a 15 kHz click (11 = 106), a 25 kHz click (n = 136), and a 25 kHz pulse with a frequency-modulated upsweep (n = 70). The 15 and 25 kHz clicks were relatively short (181 and 144 ms, respectively); the longer 25 kHz upswept pulse was 288 ms. Burst pulses were long (0.5 s) click trains with approximately 240 clicks/s.

   dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) detected in expression sequence tag
   analysis
SO MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
AB EST analysis based on the megaclone-megasorting method was performed using leukocytes from the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) with or without LPS stimulation. A total of 849 upregulated and 384 downregulated EST clones were sequenced, annotated, and functionally classified. Ferritin heavy peptide I was the most abundant upregulated transcript, suggesting that LPS stimulation induced high production of reactive oxygen species, which were sequestered in ferritin. Among the immune factors, the transcripts coding for an IL-1Ra, homologs to bovine serum amyloid A3, and canine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were highly expressed. Markedly downregulated transcripts of immune factors were those for homologs of calcium-binding proteins belonging to the S100 family, S100A12, S100A8, and S100A6. Time-course experiments on the expression of some immune factors including IL-1Ra suggested that these factors interact and control cetacean innate immunity.

TI The functional significance of colouration in cetaceans
SO EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY
AB Cetaceans show many of the classic mammalian colouration patterns, such as uniform colouration, countershading, and prominent patches of colour, all within one relatively small taxon. We collated all the functional hypotheses for cetacean colouration that have been put forward in the literature and systematically tested them using comparative phylogenetic analyses. We found that countershading is a mechanism by which smaller cetacean species may avoid being seen by their prey. We discovered that prominent markings are associated with group living, fast swimming, and ostentatious behaviour at the surface, suggesting that they function in intraspecific communication. White markings on several parts of the body seem to be involved in the capture of fish, squid, and krill. Therefore, several different selection pressures have shaped the great diversity of skin colouration seen in extant cetaceans, although background matching, disruptive colouration and interspecific communication do not appear to be involved.

SO AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB A juvenile offshore bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found stranded with neurological signs and unable to swim or float unassisted. It subsequently died, succumbing to a combination of severe pneumonia and encephalitis. Morbillivirus serum neutralisation test serology was positive (titre 1: 16) for cetacean morbillivirus and negative for both phocine distemper virus and canine distemper virus. There was concurrent thymic and lymph node lymphoid depletion and necrosis, together with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic acidophilic viral inclusion bodies and multinucleate syncytia within multiple organs. Paramyxovirus capsids were identified in lung sections via electron microscopy and morbillivirus antigen was demonstrated within sections of lung, thymus and brain by immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction formorbillivirus nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes were positive and phylogenetic gene product sequence analysis revealed 98% and 94% sequence identity to dolphin morbillivirus, respectively. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a cetacean mortality due to morbillivirus infection occurring in the southern hemisphere. Morbillivirus infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of stranded live or dead cetaceans in Australian waters, particularly if animals display neurological signs.

TI Phylogenomic analyses and improved resolution of Cetartiodactyla
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB The remarkable antiquity, diversity, and significance in the ecology and evolution of Cetartiodactyla have inspired numerous attempts to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. However, previous analyses based on limited samples of nuclear genes or mitochondria! DNA sequences have generated results that were either inconsistent with one another, weakly supported, or highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here, we present strongly supported results based upon over 1.4 Mb of an aligned DNA sequence matrix from 110 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes of 21 Cetartiodactyla species, which represent major Cetartiodactyla lineages, and three species of Perissodactyla and Carnivora as outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of this newly developed genomic sequence data using a codon-based model and recently developed models of the rate autocorrelation resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the major cetartiodactylan lineages and of those lineages with a high degree of confidence. Cetacea was found to nest within Artiodactyla as the sister group of Hippopotamidae, and Tylopoda was corroborated as the sole base clade of Cetartiodactyla. Within Cetacea, the monophyletic status of Odontoceti relative to Mysticeti, the basal position of Physeteroidea in Odontoceti, the non-monophyly of the river dolphins, and the sister relationship between Delphinidae and Monodontidae + Phocoenidae were strongly supported. In particular, the groups of Tursiops (bottlenose dolphins) and Stenella (spotted dolphins) were validated as unnatural groups. Additionally, a very narrow time frame of similar to 3 My (million years) was found for the rapid diversification of delphinids in the late Miocene, which made it difficult to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the Delphinidae, especially for previous studies with limited data sets. The present study provides a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework of Cetartiodactyla, which represents an important step toward ending some of the often-heated, century-long debate on their evolution.

TI Whale phylogeny and rapid radiation events revealed using novel
   retroposed elements and their flanking sequences
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB Background: A diversity of hypotheses have been proposed based on both morphological and molecular data to reveal phylogenetic relationships within the order Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises, and whales), and great progress has been made in the past two decades. However, there is still some controversy concerning relationships among certain cetacean taxa such as river dolphins and delphinoid species, which needs to be further addressed with more markers in an effort to address unresolved portions of the phylogeny.
   Results: An analysis of additional SINE insertions and SINE-flanking sequences supported the monophyly of the order Cetacea as well as Odontocete, Delphinoidea (Delphinidae + Phocoenidae + Mondontidae), and Delphinidae. A sister relationship between Delphinidae and Phocoenidae + Mondontidae was supported, and members of classical river dolphins and the genera Tursiops and Stenella were found to be paraphyletic. Estimates of divergence times revealed rapid divergences of basal Odontocete lineages in the Oligocene and Early Miocene, and a recent rapid diversification of Delphinidae in the Middle-Late Miocene and Pliocene within a narrow time frame.
   Conclusions: Several novel SINEs were found to differentiate Delphinidae from the other two families (Monodontidae and Phocoenidae), whereas the sister grouping of the latter two families with exclusion of Delphinidae was further revealed using the SINE-flanking sequences. Interestingly, some anomalous PCR amplification patterns of SINE insertions were detected, which can be explained as the result of potential ancestral SINE polymorphisms and incomplete lineage sorting. Although a few loci were potentially anomalous, this study demonstrated that the SINE-based approach is a powerful tool in phylogenetic studies. Identifying additional SINE elements that resolve the relationships in the superfamily Delphinoidea and family Delphinidae will be important steps forward in completely resolving cetacean phylogenetic relationships in the future.

TI Lethal entanglement in baleen whales
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB Understanding the scenarios whereby fishing gear entanglement of large whales induces mortality is important for the development of mitigation strategies. Here we present a series of 21 cases involving 4 species of baleen whales in the NW Atlantic, describing the available sighting history, necropsy observations, and subsequent data analyses that enabled the compilation of the manners in which entanglement can be lethal. The single acute cause of entanglement mortality identified was drowning from entanglement involving multiple body parts, with the animal's inability to surface. More protracted causes of death included impaired foraging during entanglement, resulting in starvation after many months; systemic infection arising from open, unresolved entanglement wounds; and hemorrhage or debilitation due to severe gear-related damage to tissues. Serious gear-induced injury can include laceration of large vessels, occlusion of the nares, embedding of line in growing bone, and massive periosteal proliferation of new bone in an attempt to wall off constricting, encircling lines. These data show that baleen whale entanglement is not only a major issue for the conservation of some baleen whale populations, but is also a major concern for the welfare of each affected individual.

TI Interactions between leatherback turtles and killer whales in Namibian
   waters, including possible predation
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB Killer whales and leatherback turtles are infrequently sighted in the coastal waters of southern Africa. Year round observations in Walvis Bay, Namibia of killer whales (2003-2010) by multiple marine tour operators and opportunistic seasonal observations of leatherback turtles made during a cetacean research project in the area (2008-2010) have been collated. Visits to coastal waters by killer whales (n = 16) are sporadic and unpredictable but are slightly higher (n = 11) between late winter (August) and late summer (March). Leatherback turtles were only seen in the warmer periods of summer months (February-March) when the surface waters exceeded 15 degrees C. Two interactions (one harassment and one probably predation) between killer whales and leatherback turtles have been recorded in Walvis Bay. This is the first report of killer whales eating leatherback turtles in the South Atlantic. These observations are noteworthy due to the low frequency of encounters of both species in the area, suggesting predation of turtles may be relatively common. Knowledge of the diet of killer whales is valuable due to the importance of dietary specialization in definition of ecotypes of the species.

TI Establishment and characterization of fibroblast cell lines from the
   skin of the Yangtze finless porpoise
SO IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL
AB The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis), as the sole freshwater subspecies of N. phocaenoides, is endemic to the Yangtze River and its adjacent lakes. Its population has declined significantly over recent decades. In this study, we established a skin-derived finite fibroblast cell line of the Yangtze finless porpoise, named YFP-SF1, using primary cell culture methods, and an immortalized cell line, T-YFP-SF1, through co-transfection (GFP and SV40 T antigens) techniques. YFP-SF1 proliferated continuously with a minimum population doubling time of 31 h and exhibited age-dependent changes in growth rate. T-YFP-SF1 cells exhibited fibroblast morphology and were characterized by a shorter doubling time, higher attachment efficiencies, colony formation at a low seeding density, and growth in low serum concentrations. Anchorage independence and foci formation in the cell monolayer were observed from passage 36. The chromosome number of YFP-SF1 and T-YFP-SF1 remained stable at 2n=44 in the early passages, and the viability of thawed cells remained above 90% after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. Taken together, we have established fibroblast cell lines of Yangtze finless porpoise for the first time, which might assist as an in vitro model for this endangered mammal.

TI Cetacean surveys in the Southern Ocean using icebreaker-supported
   helicopters
SO POLAR BIOLOGY
AB Cetaceans in the Southern Ocean are potentially impacted by anthropogenic activities, such as direct hunting or through indirect effects of a reduced sea ice due to climate change. Knowledge on the distribution of cetacean species in this area is important for conservation, but the remoteness of the study area and the presence of sea ice make it difficult to conduct shipboard surveys to obtain this information. In this study, aerial surveys were conducted from ship-based helicopters. In the 2006/07 (ANT XXIII/8) and 2008/09 (ANT XXV/2) polar summers, the icebreaker RV 'Polarstern' conducted research cruises in the Weddell Sea, which offered the opportunity to use the helicopters to conduct dedicated cetacean surveys. Combining the results from both cruises, over 26,000 km were covered on survey effort, 13 different cetacean species were identified, and a total of 221 cetacean sightings consisting of a total of 650 animals were made. Using digital photography, it was possible to identify four different beaked whale species and to conduct individual photo-identification of humpback and southern right whales. Helicopter surveys allow the collection of additional information on sightings, (e. g. group size, species), as well as the coverage of areas with high ice coverage. The flexibility and manoeuvrability of helicopters make them a powerful scientific tool to investigate cetaceans in the Southern Ocean, especially in combination with an icebreaker.

TI A major feeding ground for cetaceans and seabirds in the south-western
   Greenland Sea
SO POLAR BIOLOGY
AB In the frame of our long-term study of the distribution of seabirds and marine mammals in polar seas, observers from this team participated in the European Arctic expeditions of icebreaking RV Polarstern during summer 2008. The main aims were to obtain more information on the mechanisms underlying the at-sea distribution of the 'higher trophic levels' and to detect possible temporal and spatial changes in numbers, especially in function of climatic changes and decreasing ice coverage in the Arctic. In total, 1,175 half-an-hour transect counts were devoted to seabird and marine mammal distribution in the Greenland and Norwegian Seas, from 14 June to 15 August, 2008. A major feeding ground for cetaceans and seabirds was detected in the south-western Greenland Sea and the Denmark Strait in the Polar Front between Polar and Arctic Water masses. For the main cetacean and seabird species, almost all individuals recorded during the whole expedition were encountered in this limited zone of 33 counts: 135 humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and 1,940 common guillemots Uria aalge. Moreover, 4,400 fulmars Fulmarus glacialis light morph were observed in this zone, i.e. close to half of the total. All were actively feeding, making this zone the major feeding ground for the higher trophic levels in the European Arctic Seas and so confirming the great importance of fronts (upwellings) for the biological productivity of the oceans. Such data are essential for a successful conservation and management of the Denmark Strait and adjacent areas.

TI Morbillivirus infection in pilot whales: strict protein requirement
   drives genetic conservation
SO ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB Morbillivirus infection of marine mammals has been documented across all of the world's oceans. Whilst infection is generally demonstrated using a variety of histopathological and serological techniques, where possible, the use of molecular techniques is being used to enable accurate genetic typing of virus strains through sequence analysis. Here, we present genetic data from dolphins and pilot whales affected by morbillivirus infection in the recent outbreak in the Mediterranean Sea during a six-month period from the end of October 2006 to April 2007. To date, very few studies have looked at characterizing outbreaks of morbillivirus infections in whale species at the molecular level. Here, we provide a full sequence for the haemagglutinin (H) gene from material derived from both a dolphin and a pilot whale from the 2007 outbreak in the Mediterranean Sea and show this virus to be 100% identical across the region analysed. Furthermore, we compare partial sequence data from the nucleocapsid (N) gene of the pilot whale material with previously published data and show evidence for strong protein conservation between these different isolates. Finally, we discuss the current classification of cetacean morbilliviruses as a single species.

TI Congenital Scoliosis of a Bottlenose Dolphin
SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB There are many reports of cetaceans with deformed and twisted bodies. Skeletal pathology descriptions have shown changes to axial skeletons because of injury, trauma, or disease. We present a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) that shows characteristic patterns of congenital skeletal deformity, including malformed vertebrae, ribs, and sternum. These malformations were consistent with segmentation and formation defects arising during early embryonic development, with a resulting cascade of deformity and compensatory pathology. In spite of severe deformities, the dolphin lived 18 yr, raised two calves, and likely would have lived longer had she not succumbed to sepsis and the piercing of the aorta caused by a stingray barb.

TI Overview of sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus mortality events in the
   Adriatic Sea, 1555-2009
SO MAMMAL REVIEW
AB 1. In the Mediterranean Sea, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus is one of eight regular cetacean species. Poor knowledge of its ecology and status, together with suspected decline in numbers, make studies of historical and present occurrence especially relevant. Long-term time series of stranding events are the most reliable data to provide a scientific framework for testing hypotheses that seek to explain the mechanisms responsible for cetacean strandings.
   2. We present a comprehensive overview of cases of sperm whale mortality and human response to such events encompassing five centuries (1555-2009) within a portion of the Mediterranean Sea that offers a wealth of historical information - the Adriatic Sea.
   3. A total of 36 mortality events were validated, involving 68 animals. Two findings of skeletal materials are also reported. The geographic distribution of strandings within the basin clearly was uneven: 44% of records (n = 16) were clustered along a 280km portion of the western Adriatic coast. A relatively high number of mortality events occurred along gently sloping sandy beaches away from suitable sperm whale habitat.
   4. Until the first half of the 20th century, live-stranded animals were routinely killed: all but one cases with known human response elicited killing attempts. Starting from the 1980s, killing was replaced by efforts to rescue the animals.
   5. Mass strandings of sperm whales have occurred since historical times in the Adriatic Sea. Mortality events involving multiple individuals accounted for at least 17% of the total sample (6 of 36 mortality events). At least 29% of live strandings (6 of 21) involved more than one individual.
   6. This study contributes a long-term dataset based on careful validation of historical information, suitable for hypothesis testing aimed at investigating spatial and temporal correlates of sperm whale strandings - particularly live strandings - as a clue to their causes.

TI What drives island-associated tropical dolphins to form mixed-species
   associations in the southwest Indian Ocean?
SO JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB Mixed-species associations are temporary aggregations of individuals of different species involved in similar activities. Such associations form for foraging, protection against predators, and social advantage. Mixed-species groups in delphinids are frequent in the wild. We aimed to understand the ecological significance of mixed-species group formation by 2 tropical delphinids, the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata), in waters surrounding the island of Mayotte in the southwestern Indian Ocean. We used sighting data collected year-round from 2004 to 2009. We encountered a total of 67 mixed-species groups (comprising 21% of all groups observed) of spinner and pantropical spotted dolphins around Mayotte. No daily or seasonal variability in the occurrence of associations was detected. Behavioral activities of single-and mixed-species groups differed significantly. Foraging was observed only in single-species groups of pantropical spotted dolphins. Mixed-species groups were larger than single-species groups. When in association, spinner dolphins used deeper waters than while in single-species groups. No evidence of association for social advantage was observed. We suggest that spinner dolphins associate with spotted dolphins for protection against predators when transiting between resting areas.

TI A postmortem study of the corpus callosum in the common minke whale
   (Balaenoptera acutorostrata)
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Cetaceans diverged from terrestrial mammals approximately 53 mya and have evolved independently since then. During this time period, they have developed a complex nervous system with many adaptations to the marine environment. This study used stereological methods to estimate the total number and diameter of the myelinated fibers in the corpus callosum of the common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (n=4). The total number of callosal fibers was estimated to 55.3 x 10(6) (range: 49.0 x 10(6)-59.1 x 10(6)). Despite large variations of the callosal area (350-950 mm(2)), there was little variation in total fiber number. The fibers with diameters ranging from 0.822 to 1.14 mu m were the most frequent, which is similar to results obtained in the human brain using the same method. There was no systematic distribution of large-, middle-, or small-sized fibers along the rostrocaudal axis of the corpus callosum. This study indicated that the corpus callosum of the common minke whale is small and has few fibers compared to terrestrial mammals.

TI Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in California waters:
   Cranial differentiation of coastal and offshore ecotypes
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Coastal and offshore bottlenose dolphins in California waters are currently assessed and managed as separate stocks. Recent molecular studies (of mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellites) have shown the two populations to be genetically differentiated. This study investigated cranial osteological differentiation of the forms. The sample analyzed included 139 skulls from live captures, direct takes, fishery bycatch, and strandings; the skulls were assigned to form based on collection locality or mtDNA haplotype. The coastal form differs from the offshore form mainly in features associated with feeding: larger and fewer teeth, more robust rostrum, larger mandibular condyle, and larger temporal fossa. This suggests that it may feed on larger and tougher prey than the offshore form. Differences between the forms in other features of the skull may reflect differences in diving behavior and sound production. Approximately 86% of the stranded specimens were estimated to be of coastal origin; based on relative estimated sizes of the two populations and assuming similar mortality rates, this suggests that a coastal carcass is about 50 times more likely to beach than an offshore one. The morphological differences between the two ecotypes indicate evolutionary adaptation to different environments and emphasize the importance of conserving the relatively small coastal population and its habitat.

TI Seasonal detection of three types of "pygmy" blue whale calls in the
   Indian Ocean
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB The Indian Ocean is an area in which a rich suite of cetacean fauna, including at least two subspecies of blue whale, is found; yet little information beyond stranding data and short-term surveys for this species is available. Pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus spp.) call data are presented that provide novel information on the seasonal and geographic distribution of these animals. Acoustic data were recorded from January 2002 to December 2003 by hydrophones at three stations of the International Monitoring System, including two near the subequatorial Diego Garcia Atoll and a third southwest of Cape Leeuwin, Australia. Automated spectrogram correlation methods were used to scan for call types attributed to pygmy blue whales. Sri Lanka calls were the most common and were detected year-round off Diego Garcia. Madagascar calls were only recorded on the northern Diego Garcia hydrophone during May and July, whereas Australia calls were only recorded at Cape Leeuwin, between December and June. Differences in geographic and seasonal patterns of these three distinct call types suggest that they may represent separate acoustic populations of pygmy blue whales and that these "acoustic populations" should be considered when assessing conservation needs of blue whales in the Indian Ocean.

TI Seasonal occurrence and distribution of Bryde's whales in the Hauraki
   Gulf, New Zealand
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB The Hauraki Gulf is a large, shallow embayment located north of Auckland City (36 degrees 51'S, 174 degrees 46'E), New Zealand. Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) are the most frequently observed balaenopterid in these waters. To assess the use of the Hauraki Gulf for this species, we examined the occurrence and distribution in relation to environmental parameters. Data were collected from a platform of opportunity during 674 daily surveys between March 2003 and February 2006. A total of 760 observations of Bryde's whales were recorded throughout the study period during 371 surveys. The number of Bryde's whales sighted/day was highest in winter, coinciding with the coolest median sea-surface temperature (14.6 degrees C). Bryde's whales were recorded throughout the Hauraki Gulf in water depths ranging from 12.1-59.8 m (mean = 42.3, SD = 5.1). Cow-calf pairs were most frequently observed during the austral autumn in water depths of 29.9-53.9 m (mean = 40.8, SD = 5.2). Data from this study suggest Bryde's whales in the Hauraki Gulf exhibit a mix of both "inshore" and "offshore" characteristics from the Bryde's whales examined off the coast of South Africa.

TI Bayesian state-space model of fin whale abundance trends from a
   1991-2008 time series of line-transect surveys in the California Current
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB 1. Estimating temporal trends in animal abundance is central to ecology and conservation, but obtaining useful trend estimates is challenging when animal detection rates vary across surveys (e.g. because of differences in observers or conditions). Methods exist for obtaining abundance estimates using capture-recapture and distance sampling protocols, but only recently have some of these been extended to allow direct estimation of abundance trends when detection rates vary. Extensions to distance sampling for > 2 surveys have not yet been demonstrated.
   2. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach for estimating abundance and population trends, using a time series of line-transect data for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus off the west coast of the United States. We use a hierarchical model to partition state and observation processes. Population density is modelled as a function of covariates and random process terms, while observed counts are modelled as an overdispersed Poisson process with rates estimated as a function of population density and detection probability, which is modelled using distance sampling theory. We used Deviance Information Criteria to make multi-model inference about abundance and trend estimates.
   3. Bayesian posterior distributions for trend parameters provide strong evidence of increasing fin whale abundance in the California Current study area from 1991 to 2008, while individual abundance estimates during survey years were considerably more precise than previously reported estimates using the same data. Assuming no change in underlying population dynamics, we predict continued increases in fin whale numbers over the next decade. Our abundance projections account for both sampling error in parameter estimates and process variance in annual abundance about the mean trend.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Bayesian hierarchical modelling offers numerous benefits for analysing animal abundance trends. In our case, these included its implicit handling of sampling covariance, flexibility to accommodate random effects and covariates, ability to compare trend models of different functional forms and ability to partition sampling and process error to make predictions. Ultimately, by placing distance sampling within a more general hierarchical framework, we obtained more precise abundance estimates and an inference about fin whale trends that would have otherwise been difficult.

TI The performance of methods based on the fractional Fourier transform for
   detecting marine mammal vocalizations
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB The analysis of cetacean vocalizations is considered using Fourier-based techniques that employ chirp functions in their decomposition. In particular, the paper considers a short-time methods based on the fractional Fourier transform for detecting frequency modulated narrow-band signals, such as dolphin whistles, and compares this to the classical short-time Fourier methods. The fractional Fourier technique explored computes transforms associated with a range of chirp rates and automatically selects the rate for the final analysis. This avoids the need for prior knowledge of signal's chirp rate. An analysis is presented that details the performance of both methods as signal detectors and allows one to determine their detection thresholds. These thresholds are then used to measure the detectability of synthetic signals. This principle is then extended to measure performance on a set of recordings of narrow-band vocalizations from a range of cetacean species. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

TI Possible cryptic stock structure for minke whales in the North Atlantic:
   Implications for conservation and management
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB The minke whale is the last of the great whale species to be hunted in significant numbers. Effective management must include an understanding of how genetic diversity is divided and distributed among putative local populations, and as for many migratory species, this is complicated for the minke whale by large-scale seasonal movement among geographic regions. The problem is that the geographic identity of breeding populations is not known, and instead these whales are predictably found and hunted where different breeding stocks may mix on seasonal feeding grounds. Here we use microsatellite DNA and mtDNA markers to investigate minke whale population structure across the species' range in the North Atlantic. We found no evidence of geographic structure comparing putative populations in recognized management areas, though some limited structure had been indicated in earlier studies. However, using individual genotypes and likelihood assignment methods, we identified two putative cryptic stocks distributed across the North Atlantic in similar proportions in different regions. Some differences in the proportional representation of these populations may explain some of the apparent differentiation between regions detected previously. The implication would be that minke whales range extensively across the North Atlantic seasonally, but segregate to some extent on at least two breeding grounds. This means that established stock boundaries in the North Atlantic, currently used for management, should be re-considered to ensure the effective conservation of genetic diversity.

TI Development of the Skull of the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (Stenella
   attenuata)
SO ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY
   BIOLOGY
AB We describe the bony and cartilaginous structures of five fetal skulls of Stenella attenuata (pantropical spotted dolphin) specimens. The specimens represent early fetal life as suggested by the presence of rostral tactile hairs and the beginnings of skin pigmentation. These specimens exhibit the developmental order of ossification of the intramembranous and endochondral elements of the cranium as well as the functional and morphological development of specific cetacean anatomical adaptations. Detailed observations are presented on telescoping, nasal anatomy, and middle ear anatomy. The development of the middle ear ossicles, ectotympanic bone, and median nasal cartilage is of interest because in the adult these structures are morphologically different from those in land mammals. We follow specific cetacean morphological characteristics through fetal development to provide insight into the form and function of the cetacean body plan. Combining these data with fossil evidence, it is possible to overlie ontogenetic patterns and discern evolutionary patterns of the cetacean skull. Anat Rec, 294:1743-1756, 2011.

TI Molecular ecology meets remote sensing: environmental drivers to
   population structure of humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean
SO HEREDITY
AB Genetic analyses of population structure can be placed in explicit environmental contexts if appropriate environmental data are available. Here, we use high-coverage and high-resolution oceanographic and genetic sequence data to assess population structure patterns and their potential environmental influences for humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA data from 94 dolphins from the coasts of South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Oman, employing frequency-based and maximum-likelihood algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. The genetic data were combined with 13 years of remote sensing oceanographic data of variables known to influence cetacean dispersal and population structure. Our analyses show strong and highly significant genetic structure between all putative populations, except for those in South Africa and Mozambique. Interestingly, the oceanographic data display marked environmental heterogeneity between all sampling areas and a degree of overlap between South Africa and Mozambique. Our combined analyses therefore suggest the occurrence of genetically isolated populations of humpback dolphins in areas that are environmentally distinct. This study highlights the utility of molecular tools in combination with high-resolution and high-coverage environmental data to address questions not only pertaining to genetic population structure, but also to relevant ecological processes in marine species.

TI Osteological pathology in a Humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Fin
   (Balaenoptera physalus) whale skeleton
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PALEOPATHOLOGY
AB The Natural History Collections, Bergen Museum, The University of Bergen, Norway, houses a large collection of Baleen whale skeletons within which one mature Fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and one juvenile Humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whale skeleton exhibit notable osteological pathologies that are reported in this brief communication. The Humpback skeleton has a large lesion on the maxilla characterised by loss of bone and remodelling. The lesion would appear to be a healing injury caused by trauma to the area of the gums and adjacent soft tissue. This specimen also exhibits numerous localised areas of infection along the length of the vertebral column and bridging between two cervical vertebrae attributed to spondyloarthropathy. Such pathologies have rarely been reported in juvenile cetaceans. The Fin whale specimen exhibits eight rib fractures, which may be the result of a boat collision and numerous areas of excess bone growth at the superior edge of the vertebral spinous processes which are of unknown aetiology but may be a consequence of the forces acting upon the spine during aquatic locomotion or dysbaric osteonecrosis, caused by diving.

TI Reconciling molecular phylogenies with the fossil record
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Historical patterns of species diversity inferred from phylogenies typically contradict the direct evidence found in the fossil record. According to the fossil record, species frequently go extinct, and many clades experience periods of dramatic diversity loss. However, most analyses of molecular phylogenies fail to identify any periods of declining diversity, and they typically infer low levels of extinction. This striking inconsistency between phylogenies and fossils limits our understanding of macroevolution, and it undermines our confidence in phylogenetic inference. Here, we show that realistic extinction rates and diversity trajectories can be inferred from molecular phylogenies. To make this inference, we derive an analytic expression for the likelihood of a phylogeny that accommodates scenarios of declining diversity, time-variable rates, and incomplete sampling; we show that this likelihood expression reliably detects periods of diversity loss using simulation. We then study the cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), a group for which standard phylogenetic inferences are strikingly inconsistent with fossil data. When the cetacean phylogeny is considered as a whole, recently radiating clades, such as the Balaneopteridae, Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, and Ziphiidae, mask the signal of extinctions. However, when isolating these groups, we infer diversity dynamics that are consistent with the fossil record. These results reconcile molecular phylogenies with fossil data, and they suggest that most extant cetaceans arose from four recent radiations, with a few additional species arising from clades that have been in decline over the last similar to 10 Myr.

TI A New Dolphin Species, the Burrunan Dolphin Tursiops australis sp nov.,
   Endemic to Southern Australian Coastal Waters
SO PLOS ONE
AB Small coastal dolphins endemic to south-eastern Australia have variously been assigned to described species Tursiops truncatus, T. aduncus or T. maugeanus; however the specific affinities of these animals is controversial and have recently been questioned. Historically 'the southern Australian Tursiops' was identified as unique and was formally named Tursiops maugeanus but was later synonymised with T. truncatus. Morphologically, these coastal dolphins share some characters with both aforementioned recognised Tursiops species, but they also possess unique characters not found in either. Recent mtDNA and microsatellite genetic evidence indicates deep evolutionary divergence between this dolphin and the two currently recognised Tursiops species. However, in accordance with the recommendations of the Workshop on Cetacean Systematics, and the Unified Species Concept the use of molecular evidence alone is inadequate for describing new species. Here we describe the macro-morphological, colouration and cranial characters of these animals, assess the available and new genetic data, and conclude that multiple lines of evidence clearly indicate a new species of dolphin. We demonstrate that the syntype material of T. maugeanus comprises two different species, one of which is the historical 'southern form of Tursiops' most similar to T. truncatus, and the other is representative of the new species and requires formal classification. These dolphins are here described as Tursiops australis sp. nov., with the common name of 'Burrunan Dolphin' following Australian aboriginal narrative. The recognition of T. australis sp. nov. is particularly significant given the endemism of this new species to a small geographic region of southern and south-eastern Australia, where only two small resident populations in close proximity to a major urban and agricultural centre are known, giving them a high conservation value and making them susceptible to numerous anthropogenic threats.

TI The Environmental History of Cetaceans in Portugal: Ten Centuries of
   Whale and Dolphin Records
SO PLOS ONE
AB The history between cetaceans and humans is documented throughout time not only in reports, descriptions, and tales but also in legal documents, laws and regulations, and tithes. This wealth of information comes from the easy spotting and identification of individuals due to their large size, surface breathing, and conspicuous above water behaviour. This work is based on historical sources and accounts accounting for cetacean presence for the period between the 12th and 17th centuries, as well as scientific articles, newspapers, illustrations, maps, non-published scientific reports, and other grey literature from the 18th century onwards. Information on whale use in Portugal's mainland has been found since as early as the 12th century and has continued to be created throughout time. No certainty can be given for medieval and earlier events, but both scavenging of stranded whales or use of captured ones may have happened. There is an increasing number of accounts of sighted, stranded, used, or captured cetaceans throughout centuries which is clearly associated with a growing effort towards the study of these animals. Scientific Latin species denominations only started to be registered from the 18th century onwards, as a consequence of the evolution of natural sciences in Portugal and increasing interest from zoologists. After the 19th century, a larger number of observations were recorded, and from the 20th century to the present day, regular scientific records have been collected. Research on the environmental history of cetaceans in Portugal shows a several-centuries-old exploitation of whales and dolphins, as resources mainly for human consumption, followed in later centuries by descriptions of natural history documenting strandings and at sea encounters. Most cetaceans species currently thought to be present in Portuguese mainland waters were at some point historically recorded.

TI Evidence of injury caused by gas bubbles in a live marine mammal:
   barotrauma in a California sea lion Zalophus californianus
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB A yearling male California sea lion Zalophus californianus with hypermetric ataxia and bilateral negative menace reflexes was brought to The Marine Mammal Center, Sausalito, California, USA, in late 2009 for medical assessment and treatment. The clinical signs were due to multiple gas bubbles within the cerebellum. These lesions were intraparenchymal, multifocal to coalescing, spherical to ovoid, and varied from 0.5 to 2.4 cm diameter. The gas composed 21.3% of the total cerebellum volume. Three rib fractures were also noted during diagnostic evaluation and were presumed to be associated with the gas bubbles in the brain. The progression of clinical signs and lesion appearance were monitored with magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive function testing and computed tomography. Gas filled voids in the cerebellum were filled with fluid on follow up images. Clinical signs resolved and the sea lion was released with a satellite tag attached. Post release the animal travelled approximately 75 km north and 80 km south of the release site and the tag recorded dives of over 150 m depth. The animal re-stranded 25 d following release and died of a subacute bronchopneumonia and pleuritis. This is the first instance of clinical injury due to gas bubble formation described in a living pinniped and the first sea lion with quantifiable cerebellar damage to take part in spatial learning and memory testing.

TI Towards a New Paradigm of Non-Captive Research on Cetacean Cognition
SO PLOS ONE
AB Contemporary knowledge of impressive neurophysiology and behavior in cetaceans, combined with increasing opportunities for studying free-ranging cetaceans who initiate sociable interaction with humans, are converging to highlight serious ethical considerations and emerging opportunities for a new era of progressive and less-invasive cetacean research. Most research on cetacean cognition has taken place in controlled captive settings, e. g., research labs, marine parks. While these environments afford a certain amount of experimental rigor and logistical control they are fraught with limitations in external validity, impose tremendous stress on the part of the captive animals, and place burdens on populations from which they are often captured. Alternatively, over the past three decades, some researchers have sought to focus their attention on the presence of free-ranging cetacean individuals and groups who have initiated, or chosen to participate in, sociable interactions with humans in the wild. This new approach, defined as Interspecies Collaborative Research between cetacean and human, involves developing novel ways to address research questions under natural conditions and respecting the individual cetacean's autonomy. It also offers a range of potential direct benefits to the cetaceans studied, as well as allowing for unprecedented cognitive and psychological research on sociable mysticetes. Yet stringent precautions are warranted so as to not increase their vulnerability to human activities or pathogens. When conducted in its best and most responsible form, collaborative research with free-ranging cetaceans can deliver methodological innovation and invaluable new insights while not necessitating the ethical and scientific compromises that characterize research in captivity. Further, it is representative of a new epoch in science in which research is designed so that the participating cetaceans are the direct recipients of the benefits.

TI Long-Term Effectiveness, Failure Rates, and "Dinner Bell" Properties of
   Acoustic Pingers in a Gillnet Fishery
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB The long-term effectiveness of acoustic pingers in reducing marine mammal bycatch was assessed for the swordfish and thresher shark drift gillnet fishery in California. Between 1990 and 2009, data on fishing gear, environmental variables, and bycatch were recorded for over 8,000 fishing sets by at-sea fishery observers, including over 4,000 sets outfitted with acoustic pingers between 1996 and 2009. Bycatch rates of cetaceans in sets with >= 30 pingers were nearly 50% lower compared to sets without pingers (p = 1.2 x 10(-6)), though this result is driven largely by common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) bycatch. Beaked whales have not been observed entangled in this fishery since 1995, the last full year of fishing without acoustic pingers. Pinger failure (>= 1 nonfunctioning pingers in a net) was noted in 3.7% of observed sets. In sets where the number of failed pingers was recorded, approximately 18% of deployed pingers had failed. Cetacean bycatch rates were 10 times higher in sets where >= 1 pingers failed versus sets without pinger failure (p = 0.002), though sample sizes for sets with pinger failure were small. No evidence of habituation to pingers by cetaceans was apparent over a 14-year period of use. Bycatch rates of California sea lions in sets with >= 30 gingers were nearly double that of sets without pingers, which prompted us to examine the potential "dinner bell" effects of pingers. Depredation of swordfish catch by California sea lions was not linked to pinger use-the best predictors of depredation were total swordfish catch, month fished, area fished, and nighttime use of deck lights on vessels.

TI Population density of Sotalia guianensis (Cetacea: Delphinidae) in the
   Cananeia region, Southeastern Brazil
SO REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB Population density in cetaceans can be estimated through photo-identification, mark-recapture, land-based observations and visual estimative. We the aim to contribute with conservation strategies, we used line transects (distance method) to estimate the population density of the river dolphin, S. guianensis, in the estuarine region of Cananeia, Southeastern Brazil. The study, developed from May 2003 until April 2004, during dry and rainy seasons and different times of the day, included a sampling area divided into three sectors according to their proximity to the open sea: Sector 1 (the closest to the open sea); Sector II (with a large flow of fresh water and a salient declivity); and Sector III (with a large flow of fresh water and non salient declivity). Onboard random sampling was carried out in all three sectors, and dolphins seen from the bow to 90 on both port and starboard sides, were registered along with their position and distance from the boat. The total density found was 12.41ind/km(2) (CV=25.53%) with an average of 2.2 individuals per group for both periods of the day, morning and afternoon. Densities also varied between dry and rainy seasons, being lower in the first with 5.77ind/km(2) (CV=27.87%) than in the second 20.28ind/km(2) (CV=31.95%), respectively. Regarding the three sectors, a non-causal heterogeneous distribution was found: Sector I was the most populated (D=33.10ind/km(2), CV=13.34%), followed by Sector II (D=7.8ind/km(2), CV=21.07%) and Sector 111 (D=3.04ind/km(2), CV=34.04%). The aforementioned area, due to its proximity to the open sea, has the highest salinity level and therefore has the greatest chance of holding most of the marine fish schools which can be cornered by dolphins on high declivity areas during fishing activities. This suggests that food availability may be the most important factor on the river dolphin's distribution in the estuary. Similar studies will contribute to a better understanding of these populations and are essential for future conservation strategies. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (3): 1275-1284. Epub 2011 September 01.

TI NEW MIDDLE EOCENE WHALES FROM THE PISCO BASIN OF PERU
SO JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY
AB Three new specimens of middle Eocene cetaceans are reported from the Pisco Basin of southern Peru. All three specimens originate from the Paracas Formation and their minimum age is constrained to about 37 Ma using Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of ash collected similar to 100 m up section from the source localities. Two new genera of archaeocete cetaceans are described along with additional material of another distinctive protocetid, which is not named pending the discovery of more complete material. Phylogenetic analysis resolves the two new genera within Basilosauridae, while the unnamed protocetid is closely related to Eocetus. The discovery of crownward protocetids in South America demonstrates that early cetaceans may have dispersed into both hemispheres prior to evolving a fully aquatic lifestyle. Geochronologic constraints on the age of new Peruvian archaeocetes establish them as the oldest whales from South America and among the oldest known from the Southern Hemisphere, which highlights the need for better sampling of marginal marine rocks from this part of the world.

TI Evolution of dental wear and diet during the origin of whales
SO PALEOBIOLOGY
AB Dental morphology changes dramatically across the artiodactyl-cetacean transition, and it is generally assumed that this reflects the evolutionary change from herbivory and omnivory to carnivory. To test hypotheses regarding tooth function and diet, we studied size and position of wear facets on the lower molars and the stable isotopes of enamel samples. We found that nearly all investigated Eocene cetaceans had dental wear different from typical wear in ungulates and isotope values indicating that they hunted similar prey and processed it similarly. The only exception is the protocetid Babiacetus, which probably ate larger prey with harder skeletons. The closest relative of cetaceans, the raoellid artiodactyl Indohyus, had wear facets that resemble those of Eocene cetaceans more than they do facets of basal artiodactyls. This is in spite of Indohyus's tooth crown morphology, which is unlike that of cetaceans, and its herbivorous diet, as indicated by stable isotopes. This implies that the evolution of masticatory function preceded that of crown morphology and diet at the origin of cetaceans.

TI What's the catch? Patterns of cetacean bycatch and depredation in
   Hawaii-based pelagic longline fisheries
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB U.S. Pacific pelagic longline fisheries operating in the central North Pacific have been subject to a series of regulations to reduce bycatch of protected species, including seabirds and sea turtles. Cetaceans are also occasionally caught, and the bycatch of false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, in the Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery currently exceeds allowable levels under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). In this study, we examined longline observer data collected between 1994 and 2009, with emphasis on 2003-2009, to identify patterns of cetacean bycatch and depredation in relation to area, time, vessel, habitat variables, fishing gear, and set characteristics. The objectives of these analyses were to identify relationships amongst fishery interaction rates and variables that could provide opportunities to reduce depredation by cetaceans, reduce the likelihood of incidentally catching a cetacean when present, or reduce the severity of injuries to cetaceans if caught. The results of this study were provided to the False Killer Whale Take Reduction Team, convened under the MMPA, as they developed a plan to reduce serious injury and mortality of false killer whales in these fisheries. No correlates were identified that could markedly reduce depredation rates, but a slight (16%) reduction in repeat depredation within a fishing trip was evident when vessels moved at least 100 km following a depredation event. The most practical option for reducing bycatch of false killer whales was determined to be the use of small (14/0-16/0) circle hooks, which could result in an estimated 6% reduction in bycatch and a greater likelihood of releasing animals with non-serious injuries. Additional research is needed to address unresolved questions relating to processes involved in depredation events and hookings or entanglements of false killer whales.

TI Toward the resolution of an explosive radiation-A multilocus phylogeny
   of oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae)
SO MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae) are the product of a rapid radiation that yielded similar to 36 extant species of small to medium-sized cetaceans that first emerged in the Late Miocene. Although they are a charismatic group of organisms that have become poster children for marine conservation, many phylogenetic relationships within Delphinidae remain elusive due to the slow molecular evolution of the group and the difficulty of resolving short branches from successive cladogenic events. Here I combine existing and newly generated sequences from four mitochondrial (mt) genes and 20 nuclear (nu) genes to reconstruct a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis for Delphinidae. This study compares maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference methods of several data sets including mtDNA, combined nuDNA, gene trees of individual nuDNA loci, and concatenated mtDNA + nuDNA. In addition, I contrast these standard phylogenetic analyses with the species tree reconstruction method of Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA). Despite finding discordance between mtDNA and individual nuDNA loci, the concatenated matrix recovers a completely resolved and robustly supported phylogeny that is also broadly congruent with BCA trees. This study strongly supports groupings such as Delphininae, Lissodelphininae, Globicephalinae, Sotalia + Delphininae, Steno + Orcaella + Globicephalinae, and Leucopleurus acutus, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, and Orcinus orca as basal delphinid taxa.

TI Assessment of nutritional condition indices across reproductive states
   in the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AB The aim of this study was to identify reliable and accurate nutritional condition indices in small cetaceans. Samples from 115 stranded striped dolphins along the eastern coast of Spain (Western Mediterranean) were collected during two die-off events (1990-1991 and 2007-2008), including animals of different reproductive states and varying nutritional conditions.
   We segmented the data according to sex and reproductive condition, because energetic demands vary considerably among these collectives, and they were considered a good sample to represent groups with different nutritional conditions.
   We compared five variables as indices to measure nutritional condition. They were: a) blubber lipid content, b) blubber trunk lipid mass (BTLM), c) muscle/blubber trunk mass ratio, d) maximum girth, and e) blubber thickness.
   Since the dolphins differed in size, each variable was regressed against standard body length, and the residuals of these regressions were used as indices of nutritional condition. Only the mean residuals of BTLM (p<0.001) and blubber lipid content (p = 0.005) varied significantly among reproductive classes. However, the mean residuals of BTLM appeared to be the most sensitive index of nutritional condition, because it discriminated better among reproductive states. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI Novel gastric helicobacters and oral campylobacters are present in
   captive and wild cetaceans
SO VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB The mammalian gastric and oral mucosa may be colonized by mixed Helicobacter and Campylobacter species, respectively, in individual animals. To better characterize the presence and distribution of Helicobacter and Campylobacter among marine mammals, we used PCR and 16S rDNA sequence analysis to examine gastric and oral samples from ten dolphins (Tursiops gephyreus), one killer whale (Orcinus orca), one false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and three wild La Plata river dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei). Helicobacter spp. DNA was widely distributed in gastric and oral samples from both captive and wild cetaceans. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two Helicobacter sequence clusters, one closely related to H. cetorum, a species isolated from dolphins and whales in North America. The second related cluster was to sequences obtained from dolphins in Australia and to gastric non-H. pylori helicobacters, and may represent a novel taxonomic group. Dental plaque sequences from four dolphins formed a third cluster within the Campylobacter genus that likely represents a novel species isolated from marine mammals. Identification of identical Helicobacter spp. DNA sequences from dental plaque, saliva and gastric fluids from the same hosts, suggests that the oral cavity may be involved in transmission. These results demonstrate that Helicobacter and Campylobacter species are commonly distributed in marine mammals, and identify taxonomic clusters that may represent novel species.

TI A review of Brucella infection in marine mammals, with special emphasis
   on Brucella pinnipedialis in the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata)
SO VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Brucella spp. were isolated from marine mammals for the first time in 1994. Two novel species were later included in the genus; Brucella ceti and Brucella pinnipedialis, with cetaceans and seals as their preferred hosts, respectively. Brucella spp. have since been isolated from a variety of marine mammals. Pathological changes, including lesions of the reproductive organs and associated abortions, have only been registered in cetaceans. The zoonotic potential differs among the marine mammal Brucella strains. Many techniques, both classical typing and molecular microbiology, have been utilised for characterisation of the marine mammal Brucella spp. and the change from the band-based approaches to the sequence-based approaches has greatly increased our knowledge about these strains. Several clusters have been identified within the B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis species, and multiple studies have shown that the hooded seal isolates differ from other pinniped isolates. We describe how different molecular methods have contributed to species identification and differentiation of B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis, with special emphasis on the hooded seal isolates. We further discuss the potential role of B. pinnipedialis for the declining Northwest Atlantic hooded seal population.

TI Plastic ingestion in Franciscana dolphins, Pontoporia blainvillei
   (Gervais and d'Orbigny, 1844), from Argentina
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Plastic debris (PD) ingestion was examined in 106 Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) incidentally captured in artisanal fisheries of the northern coast of Argentina. Twenty-eight percent of the dolphins presented PD in their stomach, but no ulcerations or obstructions were recorded in the digestive tracts. PD ingestion was more frequent in estuarine (34.6%) than in marine (19.2%) environments, but the type of debris was similar. Packaging debris (cellophane, bags, and bands) was found in 64.3% of the dolphins, with a lesser proportion (35.7%) ingesting fishery gear fragments (monofilament lines, ropes, and nets) or of unknown sources (25.0%). PD ingestion correlated with ontogenetic changes in feeding regimes, reaching maximum values in recently weaned dolphins. Because a simultaneous increase in gillnet entanglement and the bioaccumulation of heavy metals take place at this stage, the first months after trophic independence should be considered as a key phase for the conservation of Franciscana dolphin stocks in northern Argentina.

TI Organochlorine concentrations in franciscana dolphins, Pontoporia
   blainvillei, from Brazilian waters
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Blubber samples were collected from ten franciscana dolphins either incidentally captured in fishing operations or stranded on Sao Paulo (SP) and Parana (PR) states littoral, Southeastern and Southern Brazilian coast, respectively. Determination of PCB, DDT and HCB concentrations were performed by capillary gas chromatograph coupled to electron capture detector (ECD). Sigma DDT, Sigma PCB and HCB concentrations ranged from 264 ng g(-1), to 5811 ng g(-1) lipid, from 909 ng g(-1) to 5849 ng g(-1) lipid and from 10 ng g(-1) to 61 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. Regarding DDTs, the distribution of the mean percentages decreased in the following order: p,p'-DDE > p,p'-DDD > p,p'-DDT. The Sigma DDT/Sigma PCB ratio varied between 0.27 and 0.42 in Northern and Central SP coast, while in Southern SP and PR coast the values were 1.6 and 1.9, respectively. Dissimilarities in Sigma DDT/Sigma PCB ratios point to different sources of organochlorine compounds to franciscana dolphins in the study area. Considering the endocrine disruptive action of organochlorine compounds, the concentrations found in franciscana dolphins from Brazilian waters may represent an additional obstacle to the conservation of this endangered cetacean species.

TI Fine-scale population genetic structuring of bottlenose dolphins in
   Irish coastal waters
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB The identification of localized discrete populations is particularly important to the management and conservation of animal species, especially in the marine environment, where potential for dispersal is high but barriers to gene flow are often not clear. We investigated population genetic structuring of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus found along the west coast of Ireland, with particular attention to the Shannon Estuary, which is the only candidate Special Area of Conservation designated for this species in Irish waters. A genetic structure analysis using 62 biopsy samples from free ranging dolphins and 23 necropsies from stranded dolphins revealed fine-scale population structure among three distinct populations. The Shannon Estuary population appears to be genetically isolated from adjacent coastal areas, with the exception of four animals sampled from a small group of six dolphins that are now resident in Cork Harbour (south coast) indicating ongoing gene flow or recent dispersal between these two areas. A second genetically distinct aggregation was identified in the Connemara-Mayo region, where recent photo-identification studies have suggested that dolphins found in this area show a degree of site fidelity. We found moderate nuclear (15 microsatellites) and low mitochondrial (544 bp of the control region) gene diversity in dolphins using the Shannon Estuary and the Connemara-Mayo region, while dolphins that stranded along the coast showed markedly higher levels of gene diversity at both classes of markers. Specifically, these stranded dolphins formed a third genetically distinct cluster, which may be part of a larger pelagic population, as also suggested by the high levels of gene diversity. These results provide new insights into population structure of bottlenose dolphins in Irish waters and will aid future management and conservation of the species in the eastern North Atlantic.

TI Basic structural and functional characteristics of the epidermal barrier
   in wild mammals living in different habitats and climates
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB Based on the combination of standard light and transmission electron microscopy, cryo-SEM, immunohistochemistry and a new sensitive glycolipid histochemical technique (5-hexadecanoylaminofluorescein staining, laser scanning microscopy), including densitometrical evaluation, our approach gives for the first time an overview of the specific biology of the epidermal permeability barrier in wild mammals (20 species from five orders), living under varying (aquatic or moist to dry) habitat conditions. The results obtained emphasised that the barrier region in most of the species studied is a continuous zone (thickness, 0.1 and 3 mu m) between the upper cells of the stratum granulosum and the inner cells of the stratum corneum conjunctum, normally present as a homogeneous glycolipid layer originating from fusion of lamellar body contents after exocytotic activities of the granular cells. However, this finding did not apply to all of the species studied, i.e., the Wild boar, the Common seal and the three large species with a very thick vital epidermis, the African elephant, the hippopotamus and the common dolphin, exhibited variations from the basic scheme. Densitometric evaluation of the 5-hexadecanoylaminofluorescein staining revealed that reaction intensity was not only generally related to the habitat conditions but also to vital epidermis thickness and hair density. The immunohistochemical demonstration of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 corroborated for all wild mammals studied that this important regulator of pH conditions during barrier formation is continuously produced in the epidermis. The variations in barrier biology observed for some species obviously had to be developed in relation to animal size (or body size area) and hair coat density, but, particularly, by the specific adaptation of certain mammalian groups to the aquatic environment. In the latter case, the typical barrier zone system was lost, as in the hippopotamus or the cetaceans.

TI Monitoring Winter and Summer Abundance of Cetaceans in the Pelagos
   Sanctuary (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea) Through Aerial Surveys
SO PLOS ONE
AB Systematic long-term monitoring of abundance is essential to inform conservation measures and evaluate their effectiveness. To instigate such work in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Mediterranean, two aerial surveys were conducted in winter and summer 2009. A total of 467 (131 in winter, 336 in summer) sightings of 7 species was made. Sample sizes were sufficient to estimate abundance of fin whales in summer (148; 95% CI = 87-254) and striped dolphins in winter (19,462; 95% CI = 12 939-29 273) and in summer (38 488; 95% CI = 27 447-53 968). Numbers of animals within the Sanctuary are significantly higher in summer, when human activities and thus potential population level impacts are highest. Comparisons with data from past shipboard surveys suggest an appreciable decrease in fin whales within the Sanctuary area and an appreciable increase in striped dolphins. Aerial surveys proved to be more efficient than ship surveys, allowing more robust estimates, with smaller CIs and CVs. These results provide essential baseline data for this marine protected area and continued regular surveys will allow the effectiveness of the MPA in terms of cetacean conservation to be evaluated and inform future management measures. The collected data may also be crucial in assessing whether ship strikes, one of the main causes of death for fin whales in the Mediterranean, are affecting the Mediterranean population.

TI The Ecological Conditions That Favor Tool Use and Innovation in Wild
   Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops sp.)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Dolphins are well known for their exquisite echolocation abilities, which enable them to detect and discriminate prey species and even locate buried prey. While these skills are widely used during foraging, some dolphins use tools to locate and extract prey. In the only known case of tool use in free-ranging cetaceans, a subset of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Western Australia habitually employs marine basket sponge tools to locate and ferret prey from the seafloor. While it is clear that sponges protect dolphins' rostra while searching for prey, it is still not known why dolphins probe the substrate at all instead of merely echolocating for buried prey as documented at other sites. By 'sponge foraging' ourselves, we show that these dolphins target prey that both lack swimbladders and burrow in a rubble-littered substrate. Delphinid echolocation and vision are critical for hunting but less effective on such prey. Consequently, if dolphins are to access this burrowing, swimbladderless prey, they must probe the seafloor and in turn benefit from using protective sponges. We suggest that these tools have allowed sponge foraging dolphins to exploit an empty niche inaccessible to their non-tool-using counterparts. Our study identifies the underlying ecological basis of dolphin tool use and strengthens our understanding of the conditions that favor tool use and innovation in the wild.

   whale (Orcinus orca)
SO THERIOGENOLOGY
AB Research was conducted to characterize seminal traits and to develop a sperm cryopreservation method using directional freezing (DF) for the killer whale (Orcinus orca). Experiments evaluated effects of: (i) freezing rate (SLOW, MED, FAST) by diluent (BF5F, Biladyl (R), EYC) in 0.5 mL straws; and (ii) freezing method (straw or DF) by glycerol (3, 6, or 9% final concentration, v:v) on in vitro sperm quality. Fresh ejaculates (n = 161) were (mean +/- SD) 7.8 +/- 7.4 mL at 740 X 10(6) sperm/mL with 92.2 +/- 6.3% total motility (TM), 85.4 +/- 6.9% progressive motility (PM), 89.6 +/- 9.0% viability and 89.8 +/- 9.2% acrosome integrity. Samples frozen using straws by the MED or SLOW method were improved (P < 0.05) over FAST across all diluents. At 3 h post thaw (PT), TM, PM, Rapid motility (RM), YAP, VCL, ALH and viability for 3% and 6% glycerol were improved (P < 0.05) over 9% glycerol. Directional freezing samples at 0 h and 3 h PT, at all glycerol concentrations, displayed higher (P < 0.001) TM, PM, RM, YAP, VSL, VCL and viability /intact acrosomes (PI/FITC-PNA) than straw. These data provided the first information on ejaculate characteristics and the development of a semen cryopreservation method using DF in the killer whale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The fecal material of 12 porpoises living in the wild in Poyang Lake and 1 porpoise living in captivity at the Wuhan Baiji Dolphinarium were examined by PCR for the presence of Helicobacter spp. The fecal material of 8 of 12 wild porpoises and the captive porpoise were positive for Helicobacter spp. as determined by PCR using Helicobacter-specific primers, which target the 16S rRNA gene. A 16S rRNA clone library was then prepared from 1 sample isolated from a female porpoise living in the wild. DNA sequence analysis from 3 of the clones showed 98 to 99% identity to the H. cetorum 16S rRNA gene. These results demonstrate the prevalence of Helicobacter spp. and H. cetorum in endangered freshwater finless porpoises.

TI A proposal to define vulnerability of cetacean areas to human
   development: variables and analysis procedures applied to the Gulf of
   California
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Understanding spatial interactions between specific sources of anthropogenic impact on cetaceans and the ecological conditions intrinsic to these mammals, has several applications for conservation and management. Here cetacean habitats are classified into vulnerability levels by combining human development metrics and cetacean characteristics, allowing areas identified as more vulnerable to be given management priority.
   2. Ten bio-physical and anthropogenic factors were identified as key shapers of cetacean habitats and, using the Gulf of California as a case study, 18 variables were defined to measure those factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) and GIS were used to distill the relationships across all variables, in order to obtain a vulnerability index. Aggregates of variables were also investigated to map the spatial distribution of anthropogenic impacts and cetacean characteristics (species richness, relative abundance of encounter, residence condition, diet specificity and threat status). For this latter purpose, separate indices representing five 'categories' (pollution from land sources, urban development, potential for accidents, resource depletion and fragility of cetacean areas) and three 'vulnerability components' (risk of hazards, intrinsic resilience and damage) were calculated.
   3. The methodology clearly differentiated the study area according to levels for each 'category' and 'vulnerability component', as well as to levels of vulnerability of cetacean areas in relation to human activities; and identified those variables with the greatest contributions, without recourse to the subjective criteria common in other approaches. The analyses were conducted using environmental units generated by the Marine Ecological Zoning Plan for the Gulf of California (OEMGC, by its Spanish acronym) which tied model outputs to this planning framework. The variables selected were easily obtainable through governmental and research institutions which make them suitable for adaptive management purposes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Distribution and Abundance Estimates for Cetaceans in the Waters off
   Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
SO PACIFIC SCIENCE
AB Cetacean distribution and abundance are reported from the first systematic line-transect visual survey in the waters of Guam and the Common-wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). The survey was conducted during January April 2007 following standard line-transect protocols. Trackline coverage (11,033 km) was dominated by high sea states (88.2%); however, 13 cetacean species were recorded. The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) was the most frequently encountered whale, followed by Bryde's and sei whales (Balaenoptera edeni and B. borealis, respectively). Occurrence of the sei whale is unique, because the species had not been confirmed to occur south of 20 degrees N. The pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) was the most frequently sighted delphinid, followed by the striped dolphin (Stenella coentleoalba) and false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens). Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were acoustically detected and later seen off Saipan. Numerous cetacean sightings were associated with steep bathymetric features including the West Mariana Ridge, the Mariana Ridge, and the Mariana Trench. Abundance estimates were based on 80 on-effort sightings for 12 species. Species were pooled into three separate groups for estimating detection probabilities: Balaenoptera spp., black-fish (medium-size odontocetes), and small dolphins. A separate detection function was generated for the sperm whale. Precision of abundance estimates are very low for all species clue to low sighting rates and high sea states; however, these abundance estimates serve as the best scientific data available for the area and establish vital baseline information for future research efforts.

TI Long-term abundance trends of the northern form of the short-finned
   pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) along the Pacific coast of
   Japan
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB The abundance of the northern form of the short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, in the Pacific waters of northern Japan was estimated from a line transect survey conducted in 2006 and data from seven previous surveys collected between 1985 and 1997. To overcome the difficulty of small sample size and inconsistency in survey design, we used an adjustment method using multiple covariates and sensitivity analysis by considering several scenarios. Abundance estimates showed similar long-term trends among scenarios. The northern form of G. macrorhynchus was more abundant in 1985 than in 1991-2006. The annual catch of the northern form of G. macrorhynchus exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR), especially in the 1980s. Thus, the commercial take in the early 1980s was suspected as a partial cause of a serious abundance decrease. These results provide valuable information for interpreting the impacts of coastal whaling, and to develop future management plans.

TI Comparative anatomy and evolutionary history of suction feeding in
   cetaceans
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Some odontocetes possess unique features of the hyolingual apparatus that are involved in suction feeding. The hyoid bone and associated musculature generates rapid, piston-like retraction, and depression of the hyoid and tongue. "Capture" suction feeders (e. g., Globicephala) use suction for capturing and swallowing prey. "Combination" feeders (i.e., Lagenorhynchus) use both raptorial feeding (to capture prey) and suction (to ingest prey). In "capture" suction feeders, features of the hyoid and skull have been attributed to creating suction (i.e., large surface area and mandibular bluntness). In addition to odontocetes, a mysticete, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), is considered a benthic suction feeder. However, anatomical studies of purported suction-feeding structures of the gray whale are lacking. In addition, few studies have utilized evolutionary approaches to understand the history of suction feeding in cetaceans. This study incorporates quantitative and qualitative hyoid and cranial data from 35 extant and 14 extinct cetacean species into a multivariate principal component analysis and comparative phylogenetic analyses. Conclusions from these analyses are that some commonly attributed features (i.e., ventral throat grooves and mandibular bluntness) and one principal component are significantly correlated with suction feeding. Finally, ancestral state reconstructions indicate that suction feeding likely evolved once, early in cetacean evolutionary history.

TI Using distance sampling techniques to estimate bottlenose dolphin
   (Tursiops truncatus) abundance at Turneffe Atoll, Belize
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Reliable abundance estimates are critical for management and conservation of coastal small cetaceans. This is particularly important in developing countries where coastal human populations are increasing, the impacts of anthropogenic activities are often unknown, and the resources necessary to assess coastal cetaceans are limited. We adapted ship-based line transect methods to small-boat surveys to estimate the abundance of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at Turneffe Atoll, Belize. Using a systematic survey design with random start and uniform coverage, 34 dolphin clusters were sighted during small-boat line transect surveys conducted in 2005-2006. Distance sampling methods estimated abundance at 216 individuals (CV = 27.7%, 95% CI = 126-370). Due to species rarity in the Atoll, small sample size, and potential violations in line transect assumptions, the estimate should be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, it provides up-to-date information on the status of a regional population in an area under increasing threat of habitat loss and prey depletion via uncontrolled development and unsustainable fishing. This information will be useful as Belize develops a new conservation initiative to create a comprehensive and resilient marine protected area system. Our study illustrates the application of distance sampling methods to small-boat surveys to obtain abundance estimates of coastal cetaceans in a region lacking resources.

TI Severe Karenia brevis red tides influence juvenile bottlenose dolphin
   (Tursiops truncatus) behavior in Sarasota Bay, Florida
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are natural stressors in the coastal environment that may be increasing in frequency and severity. This study investigates whether severe red tide blooms, caused by Karenia brevis, affect the behavior of resident coastal bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida through changes to juvenile dolphin activity budgets, ranging patterns, and social associations. Behavioral observations were conducted on free-ranging juvenile dolphins during the summer months of 2005-2007, and behavior during red tide blooms was compared to periods of background K. brevis abundance. We also utilized dolphin group sighting data from 2004 to 2007 to obtain comparison information from before the most severe recent red tide of 2005 and incorporate social association information from adults in the study area. We found that coastal dolphins displayed a suite of behavioral changes associated with red tide blooms, including significantly altered activity budgets, increased sociality, and expanded ranging behavior. At present, we do not fully understand the mechanism behind these red tide-associated behavioral effects, but they are most likely linked to underlying changes in resource availability and distribution. These behavioral changes have implications for more widespread population impacts, including increased susceptibility to disease outbreaks, which may contribute to unusual mortality events during HABs.

   FROM KUTCH, INDIA
SO JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY
AB The family Remingtonocetidae is a basal family of Eocene cetaceans only known from near shore marine environments of India and Pakistan. We describe a new skull for Remingtonocetus harudiensis which elucidates the anatomy and functional morphology of the head and provides new details on cranial cavity and nasopharyngeal region. We suggest that Remingtonocetus was an ambush predator that hunted from a perch on the ocean floor, and that hearing was its most important sense. We speculate that the greatly elongated rostrum is an adaptation for water retention because these are some of the earliest whales living in seawater.

TI Aspergillosis in the middle ear of a harbour porpoise (Phocoena
   phocoena): a case report
SO MYCOSES
AB Hearing is one of the major senses in whales and dolphins (cetaceans). This is the first report of severe mycotic otitis media in a cetacean, a juvenile female harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) from British waters that stranded alive. Gross examinations were followed by histological and microbiological investigations of the auditory apparatus. Both tympanic cavities and periotic sinuses displayed copious greenish-yellow purulent and caseous material. Severe fungal infestation by Aspergillus terreus was documented in the otic region but not in any other site of the body. Adjacent to the promontorium, massive accumulation of fibrinous secretion and infiltration of clusters of inflammatory cells were present. Newly formed cysts and vessels replaced the round window membrane location, reminiscent of granulation tissue. Inflammatory cells and a severe fibrin net were noted within the perilymphatic spaces of scala tympani and scala vestibuli, indicative of an acute fibrinous otitis. Inflammatory reactions have probably been caused by this fungal organism. The basilar membrane was solely covered by a simple cuboidal epithelium. Complete absence of sensory cells of the Organ of Corti characterised a further severe phenomenon, which possibly led to the animal's poor nutritional status and stranding. Potential portals of entry are being discussed.

TI Hyperbaric computed tomographic measurement of lung compression in seals
   and dolphins
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Lung compression of vertebrates as they dive poses anatomical and physiological challenges. There has been little direct observation of this. A harbor and a gray seal, a common dolphin and a harbor porpoise were each imaged post mortem under pressure using a radiolucent, fiberglass, water-filled pressure vessel rated to a depth equivalent of 170 m. The vessel was scanned using computed tomography (CT), and supported by a rail and counterweighted carriage magnetically linked to the CT table movement. As pressure increased, total buoyancy of the animals decreased and lung tissue CT attenuation increased, consistent with compression of air within the lower respiratory tract. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the external surface of the porpoise chest showed a marked contraction of the chest wall. Estimation of the volumes of different body compartments in the head and chest showed static values for all compartments except the lung, which showed a pressure-related compression. The depth of estimated lung compression ranged from 58 m in the gray seal with lungs inflated to 50% total lung capacity (TLC) to 133 m in the harbor porpoise with lungs at 100% TLC. These observations provide evidence for the possible behavior of gas within the chest of a live, diving mammal. The estimated depths of full compression of the lungs exceeds previous indirect estimates of the depth at which gas exchange ceases, and concurs with pulmonary shunt measurements. If these results are representative for living animals, they might suggest a potential for decompression sickness in diving mammals.

TI Audiogram of a stranded Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon
   densirostris) measured using auditory evoked potentials
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Quantifying and understanding the impact of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals has been the focus of many researchers both in laboratory settings as well as in the field. This study presents the audiogram of a sub-adult Blainville's beaked whale that stranded in Hawaii. The hearing measurements were conducted using the non-invasive auditory brainstem response technique. A total of 11 sinusoidally amplitude modulated tones were tested ranging from 5.6 to 160 kHz. The audiogram data indicated that the region of best hearing was found between 40 and 50 kHz with thresholds below 50 dB. This frequency range partially overlaps with the frequency modulated upsweep that Blainville's beaked whales have been reported to use during echolocation. These results match the frequency range obtained from the hearing measurements of a Gervais' beaked whale previously tested using contact acoustic stimulation and emphasize the importance of obtaining rapid hearing measurements on live stranded animals to improve the understanding of poorly known species.

TI Use of blubber levels of progesterone to determine pregnancy in

SO MARINE BIOLOGY
AB We tested the possibility of measuring progesterone levels in bubbler samples collected from free-ranging live bottlenose dolphins (n = 11) and long-finned pilot whales (n = 2) as a tool to evaluate the pregnancy status of individuals. Samples were collected during January 2004 and September-October 2005 in the Strait of Gibraltar and Gulf of Cadiz and used for sex-determination by genetic methods (skin samples) and for quantification of progesterone levels by enzyme immunoassay. Photo-identification tracking of females after taking the biopsy was used to observe the presence of newborns and, in this way, to determine if the female was pregnant at the time of sampling. Mean progesterone levels from pregnant bottlenose dolphins (n = 2) were around 9 times higher than those from non-pregnant females (n = 9), with no overlap between concentration ranges demonstrating that this method could constitute an effective tool for determining pregnancy in wild populations of bottlenose dolphins and other cetacean species.

TI Spatiotemporal patterns of marine mammal distribution in coastal waters
   of Galicia, NW Spain
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB The spatial and seasonal distribution of cetaceans and possible links with environmental conditions were studied at the Galician continental shelf. Data were collected between February-August 2001 and June-September 2003 during opportunistic surveys onboard fishing boats. Seven species of cetaceans were identified from 250 sightings of 6,846 individuals. The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) was by far the most frequently sighted and the most widely distributed species. Spatiotemporal trends in cetacean distribution and abundance, and their relationships with environmental parameters (sea depth, SST and chlorophyll-a) were quantified using generalised additive models (GAMs). Results for all cetaceans were essentially the same as for common dolphins alone. Modelling results indicated that the number of common dolphin sightings per unit effort was higher further south. The number of individual common dolphins seen per sighting of this species (i.e. group size) was however higher in the north and west of the study area, higher later in the year and higher in 2001 than in 2003. In contrast, the number of common dolphin calves seen (per sighting of this species) was higher in the south. Models including environmental variables indicated larger common dolphin group sizes in deeper waters and at higher chlorophyll concentrations (i.e. in more productive areas). There was also a positive relationship between survey effort and group size, which is probably an artefact of the tendency of the survey platforms (fishing boats) to spend most time in areas of high fish abundance. Numbers of common dolphin calves per sighting were found to be higher in shallower waters. The results are consistent with common dolphins foraging mainly in deeper waters of the Galician continental shelf, while more southern inshore waters may represent a nursery area.

TI Fine-scale genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus,
   in Atlantic coastal waters of the Iberian Peninsula
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB In the NE Atlantic, evidence has been found of genetic discontinuities between Iberian bottlenose dolphins and those of Scotland and the Mediterranean. Here, we explored the genetic relationships between resident populations of dolphins from southern Galicia (NW Spain) and the Sado estuary (S Portugal), and their relationship with dolphins inhabiting neighbouring areas. A total of 91 skin and muscle samples were taken from stranded and biopsied animals between 1994 and 2008 in southern Galicia (N = 29), the Sado estuary (N = 5) and five other geographical locations (N = 57) including sites around the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands and the Azores. Individuals were genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci and sequenced at the highly variable mitochondrial control region. From individual-based analyses of microsatellite data, dolphins from southern Galicia and the Sado estuary were assigned to an individual genetic population, though nine dolphins were identified as possible migrants between putative populations as their genetic makeup did not correspond with their geographical stranding location. Pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation (F (ST)) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA also revealed genetic differences between populations. The existence of fine-scale population substructure should be considered in the future designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) for the species, as required by the European Habitats Directive.

TI Shifting baselines in scientific publications: A case study using
   cetacean research
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The marine sciences have undergone a sequence of historical changes related to new methodologies, approaches and challenges. Most recently, deteriorating natural ecosystems and threatened component species have prompted a renewed change in the focus of scientific research on the marine environment. This study analyzes the scientific literature on cetaceans during the period 2005-2008 to demonstrate that a key focus of modern research is on conservation-related topics, and then compares it to the period 1970-1973 to demonstrate that this new focus represents a shift from basic biological and ecological issues. On average, approximately 46% of papers published on whales, dolphins and porpoises in 2005-2008 were categorized as conservation oriented versus focused on biology or ecology. This contrasts to approximately 10% in 1970-1973. This shift parallels other marine research subjects, such as benthic communities, coral reefs and sea turtles and reflects a general paradigm shift in marine research towards anthropogenic impacts. This is important guidance for institutions and organizations that wish to base their agendas and decisions on state-of-the-art scientific priorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ten guiding principles for the delineation of priority habitat for
   endangered small cetaceans
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The adoption of endangered species laws in various nations has intensified efforts to better understand, and protect, at-risk species or populations, and their habitats. In many countries, delineating a portion of a species' habitat as particularly worthy of protection has become a mantra of these laws. Unfortunately, the laws themselves often provide scientists and managers with few, if any, guidelines for how to define such habitat. Conservationists and scientists may view protecting part of the habitat of an endangered species as an ineffectual compromise, while managers may be under pressure to allow a range of human activities within the species' habitat. In the case of small cetaceans, establishing boundaries for such areas can also be complicated by their mobility, the fluid nature of their environment, and the often ephemeral nature of their habitat features. The convergence of multiple human impacts in coastal waters around the world is impacting many small cetaceans (and other species) that rely on these areas for feeding, reproducing, and resting. The ten guiding principles presented here provide a means to characterize the habitat needs of small, at-risk cetaceans, and serve as a basis for the delineation of 'priority habitat' boundaries. This conceptual approach should facilitate a constructive discourse between scientists and managers engaged in efforts to recover endangered species. The degree to which the recovery of an at-risk species can be reconciled with sustainable economic activity will depend in part on how well these principles are incorporated into the delineation of priority habitat.

TI The Comparative Osteology of the Petrotympanic Complex (Ear Region) of
   Extant Baleen Whales (Cetacea: Mysticeti)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Anatomical comparisons of the ear region of baleen whales (Mysticeti) are provided through detailed osteological descriptions and high-resolution photographs of the petrotympanic complex (tympanic bulla and petrosal bone) of all extant species of mysticete cetaceans. Salient morphological features are illustrated and identified, including overall shape of the bulla, size of the conical process of the bulla, morphology of the promontorium, and the size and shape of the anterior process of the petrosal. We place our comparative osteological observations into a phylogenetic context in order to initiate an exploration into petrotympanic evolution within Mysticeti.
   Principal Findings: The morphology of the petrotympanic complex is diagnostic for individual species of baleen whale (e. g., sigmoid and conical processes positioned at midline of bulla in Balaenoptera musculus; confluence of fenestra cochleae and perilymphatic foramen in Eschrichtius robustus), and several mysticete clades are united by derived characteristics. Balaenids and neobalaenids share derived features of the bulla, such as a rhomboid shape and a reduced anterior lobe (swelling) in ventral aspect, and eschrichtiids share derived morphologies of the petrosal with balaenopterids, including loss of a medial promontory groove and dorsomedial elongation of the promontorium. Monophyly of Balaenoidea (Balaenidae and Neobalaenidae) and Balaenopteroidea (Balaenopteridae and Eschrichtiidae) was recovered in phylogenetic analyses utilizing data exclusively from the petrotympanic complex.
   Significance: This study fills a major gap in our knowledge of the complex structures of the mysticete petrotympanic complex, which is an important anatomical region for the interpretation of the evolutionary history of mammals. In addition, we introduce a novel body of phylogenetically informative characters from the ear region of mysticetes. Our detailed anatomical descriptions, illustrations, and comparisons provide valuable data for current and future studies on the phylogenetic relationships, evolution, and auditory physiology of mysticetes and other cetaceans throughout Earth's history.

TI Underestimating the damage: interpreting cetacean carcass recoveries in
   the context of the Deepwater Horizon/BP incident
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Evaluating impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems is difficult when effects occur out of plain sight. Oil spill severity is often measured by the number of marine birds and mammals killed, but only a small fraction of carcasses are recovered. The Deepwater Horizon/BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest in the U.S. history, but some reports implied modest environmental impacts, in part because of a relatively low number (101) of observed marine mammal mortalities. We estimate historical carcass-detection rates for 14 cetacean species in the northern Gulf of Mexico that have estimates of abundance, survival rates, and stranding records. This preliminary analysis suggests that carcasses are recovered, on an average, from only 2% (range: 0-6.2%) of cetacean deaths. Thus, the true death toll could be 50 times the number of carcasses recovered, given no additional information. We discuss caveats to this estimate, but present it as a counterpoint to illustrate the magnitude of misrepresentation implicit in presenting observed carcass counts without similar qualification. We urge methodological development to develop appropriate multipliers. Analytical methods are required to account explicitly for low probability of carcass recovery from cryptic mortality events (e.g., oil spills, ship strikes, bycatch in unmonitored fisheries and acoustic trauma).

TI Distribution, abundance, and movements of the bottlenose dolphin
   (Tursiops truncatus) in the Pelagos Sanctuary MPA (north-west
   Mediterranean Sea)
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. The Pelagos Sanctuary is the largest marine protected area of the Mediterranean Sea (87 500 km(2)), and is located in the north-west part of the basin. The presence of the bottlenose dolphin in this area is well documented but its distribution and abundance are not well known.
   2. The present study collected and analysed data from 10 different research groups operating in the Pelagos Sanctuary from 1994 to 2007. Photo-identification data were used to analyse the displacement behaviour of the dolphins and to estimate their abundance through mark-recapture modelling.
   3. Results show that the distribution of bottlenose dolphin is confined to the continental shelf within the 200 m isobath, with a preference for shallow waters of less than 100 m depth.
   4. Bottlenose dolphins seem to be more densely present in the eastern part of the sanctuary and along the north-west coast of Corsica.
   5. Bottlenose dolphins show a residential attitude with excursions usually within a distance of 80 km (50 km on average). A few dolphins exhibit more wide-ranging journeys, travelling up to 427 km between sub-areas.
   6. The displacement analysis identified two (sub)populations of bottlenose dolphins, one centred on the eastern part of the sanctuary and the other one around the west coast of Corsica.
   7. In 2006, the eastern (sub)population was estimated to comprise 510-552 individuals, while 368-429 individuals were estimated in the Corsican (sub)population. It was estimated that in total, 884-1023 bottlenose dolphins were living in the Pelagos Sanctuary MPA in the same year.
   8. The designation of a number of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive is discussed as a possible tool to protect the bottlenose dolphin in the Pelagos Sanctuary and in the whole of the Mediterranean Sea. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Marine mammals and debris in coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Entanglement in and ingestion of synthetic marine debris is increasingly recognized worldwide as an important stressor for marine wildlife, including marine mammals. Studying its impact on wildlife populations is complicated by the inherently cryptic nature of the problem. The coastal waters of British Columbia (BC), Canada provide important habitat for marine mammal species, many of which have unfavorable conservation status in the US and Canada. As a priority-setting exercise, we used data from systematic line-transect surveys and spatial modeling methods to map at-sea distribution of debris and 11 marine mammal species in BC waters, and to identify areas of overlap. We estimated abundance of 36,000 (CIs: 23,000-56,600) pieces of marine debris in the region. Areas of overlap were often far removed from urban centers, suggesting that the extent of marine mammal-debris interactions would be underestimated from opportunistic sightings and stranding records, and that high-overlap areas should be prioritized by stranding response networks.

TI Cytochrome P450 1A1 expression in cetacean skin biopsies from the Indian
   Ocean
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The study describes cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYPA1) expression in the skin of different cetacean species (Megaptera novaeangliae, n = 15; Stenella attenuata, n = 7 and Stenella longirostris, n = 24) from the Mozambique Channel island of Mayotte. Immunohistochemical examination was performed with a monoclonal antibody against scup cytochrome CYPA1. The sex was determined using a molecular approach consisting in the genotyping sex-specific genes. CYPA1 was detected at the junction between epidermis and blubber on dolphins only, mostly in the endothelial cells. Similar observation was obtained in the dermis of one M. novaeangliae. Immunohistochemical slides were scored to evaluate the expression of the CYPA1 and a higher expression was observed in S. longirostris, suggesting a higher exposure to pollutants for this species. The difference of expression between sexes was not significant. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) in the southwestern Gulf of
   California: Relationship with ENSO variability and prey availability
SO CIENCIAS MARINAS
AB Interannual changes in the occurrence of Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) have been observed in La Paz Bay (southwestern Gulf of California, Mexico) over the last 20 years. We suggest that these changes could be driven by natural fluctuations in food resources that are related to climate variability. We compared monthly Bryde's whale occurrence in La Paz Bay from 1988 to 2006 to climate variability at seasonal and interannual time scales and its effect on prey availability. The results showed that Bryde's whales do not have a well-defined pattern of seasonal occurrence; however, large numbers of whales were consistently recorded during La Nina conditions when the Gulf of California sardine population is distributed further south within the gulf. In contrast, fewer whales were recorded during El Nino and neutral conditions. This indicates that changes in the occurrence of Bryde's whales at La Paz Bay are driven by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation interannual variability and are probably mediated by their prey availability.

TI Cetacean population density estimation from single fixed sensors using
   passive acoustics
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB Passive acoustic methods are increasingly being used to estimate animal population density. Most density estimation methods are based on estimates of the probability of detecting calls as functions of distance. Typically these are obtained using receivers capable of localizing calls or from studies of tagged animals. However, both approaches are expensive to implement. The approach described here uses a MonteCarlo model to estimate the probability of detecting calls from single sensors. The passive sonar equation is used to predict signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of received clicks, which are then combined with a detector characterization that predicts probability of detection as a function of SNR. Input distributions for source level, beam pattern, and whale depth are obtained from the literature. Acoustic propagation modeling is used to estimate transmission loss. Other inputs for density estimation are call rate, obtained from the literature, and false positive rate, obtained from manual analysis of a data sample. The method is applied to estimate density of Blainville's beaked whales over a 6-day period around a single hydrophone located in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. Results are consistent with those from previous analyses, which use additional tag data. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3583504]

TI The Use of Carcasses for the Analysis of Cetacean Population Genetic
   Structure: A Comparative Study in Two Dolphin Species
SO PLOS ONE
AB Advances in molecular techniques have enabled the study of genetic diversity and population structure in many different contexts. Studies that assess the genetic structure of cetacean populations often use biopsy samples from free-ranging individuals and tissue samples from stranded animals or individuals that became entangled in fishery or aquaculture equipment. This leads to the question of how representative the location of a stranded or entangled animal is with respect to its natural range, and whether similar results would be obtained when comparing carcass samples with samples from free-ranging individuals in studies of population structure. Here we use tissue samples from carcasses of dolphins that stranded or died as a result of bycatch in South Australia to investigate spatial population structure in two species: coastal bottlenose (Tursiops sp.) and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). We compare these results with those previously obtained from biopsy sampled free-ranging dolphins in the same area to test whether carcass samples yield similar patterns of genetic variability and population structure. Data from dolphin carcasses were gathered using seven microsatellite markers and a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Analyses based on carcass samples alone failed to detect genetic structure in Tursiops sp., a species previously shown to exhibit restricted dispersal and moderate genetic differentiation across a small spatial scale in this region. However, genetic structure was correctly inferred in D. delphis, a species previously shown to have reduced genetic structure over a similar geographic area. We propose that in the absence of corroborating data, and when population structure is assessed over relatively small spatial scales, the sole use of carcasses may lead to an underestimate of genetic differentiation. This can lead to a failure in identifying management units for conservation. Therefore, this risk should be carefully assessed when planning population genetic studies of cetaceans.

TI Current and Future Patterns of Global Marine Mammal Biodiversity
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantifying the spatial distribution of taxa is an important prerequisite for the preservation of biodiversity, and can provide a baseline against which to measure the impacts of climate change. Here we analyse patterns of marine mammal species richness based on predictions of global distributional ranges for 115 species, including all extant pinnipeds and cetaceans. We used an environmental suitability model specifically designed to address the paucity of distributional data for many marine mammal species. We generated richness patterns by overlaying predicted distributions for all species; these were then validated against sightings data from dedicated long-term surveys in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, the Northeast Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Model outputs correlated well with empirically observed patterns of biodiversity in all three survey regions. Marine mammal richness was predicted to be highest in temperate waters of both hemispheres with distinct hotspots around New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, the Galapagos Islands, the Southeast Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. We then applied our model to explore potential changes in biodiversity under future perturbations of environmental conditions. Forward projections of biodiversity using an intermediate Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) temperature scenario predicted that projected ocean warming and changes in sea ice cover until 2050 may have moderate effects on the spatial patterns of marine mammal richness. Increases in cetacean richness were predicted above 40 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, while decreases in both pinniped and cetacean richness were expected at lower latitudes. Our results show how species distribution models can be applied to explore broad patterns of marine biodiversity worldwide for taxa for which limited distributional data are available.

TI Dental pathology in dolphins (Cetacea: Delphinidae) from the southern
   coast of Brazil
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB Pathological processes observed in the stomatognathic systems of mammalian species are a useful source of information about the habits, evolution and general health of such animals. Studies of pathological conditions on teeth are common in humans and other primates, but rare in wild animals in general and marine mammals in particular. For cetaceans, previous studies provided scanty records of dental anomalies in a few species. This is the first broad and systematic inventory of dental pathology in dolphins. Specimens stored at scientific collections from the southern coast of Brazil were visually inspected under a stereoscopic microscope using a dental explorer. Diagnosis of lesions and anomalies followed literature descriptions. Abnormalities such as caries-like lesions, mineralized calculus deposits, dental erosion, enamel anomalies (hypoplasia and exogenous pigmentation), root resorption, germination and other shape anomalies, were diagnosed in the delphinids Sotalia guianensis, Delphinus capensis, Stenella frontalis, Stenella coeruleoalba, Lagenodelphis hosei, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Steno bredanensis and Tursiops truncatus. Endogenous causes may be related to the occurrence of certain conditions, but the aetiology of caries-like lesions and calculus accumulation is still unknown for cetaceans. The diagnosis of alveolar anomalies and other bone lesions in specimens with dental pathology lead us to believe these lesions modify the integrity of the periodontal ligament and bony tissues, adding to the burden of morbidity of affected animals.

TI Sociability of Female Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops spp.) and
   Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): Understanding Evolutionary Pathways
   Toward Social Convergence
SO EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY
AB On the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) occasionally pass through Admiralty Bay in large, fast-traveling groups of 100 or so individuals. Watching such a group race and splash through the water is reminiscent of a stampeding herd of ungulates, cetaceans' closest terrestrial ancestors. At other times, smaller social groups of bottlenose dolphins appear in the bay and provide a glimpse of the behavioral complexity that dolphins share with their distant relatives, the primates (Fig. 1). Despite being evolutionarily separated for 95 million years(1) and evolving in vastly different environments, cetaceans and primates share striking similarities in behavior, socioecological problem-solving, life-history patterns, and cognitive capacity.(2) By comparing attributes shared by primates and cetaceans, distraction from phylogenetic "noise" is minimized and our understanding of evolutionary pathways is enhanced. In particular, cetaceans provide a powerful outgroup for studying the evolution of primate social organization.

TI Ovarian Cycle Approach by Rectal Temperature and Fecal Progesterone in a
   Female Killer Whale, Orcinus orca
SO ZOO BIOLOGY
AB This study aimed to validate the measurements of body temperature and fecal progesterone concentrations as minimally invasive techniques for assessing ovarian cycle in a single sexually mature female killer whale. Rectal temperature data, fecal and blood samples were collected in the dorsal position using routine husbandry training on a voluntary basis. The correlations between rectal temperature and plasma progesterone concentration and between fecal and plasma progesterone concentrations were investigated. Fecal progesterone metabolites were identified by a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and enzyme immunoassay. Plasma progesterone concentrations (range: 0.2-18.6 ng/ml) and rectal temperature (range: 35.3-35.91 degrees C) changed cyclically, and cycle lengths were an average (+/- SD) of 44.9 +/- 4.0 days (nine cycles) and 44.6 +/- 5.9 days (nine cycles), respectively. Rectal temperature positively correlated with the plasma progesterone concentrations (r = 0.641, P < 0.01). There was a visual trend for fecal progesterone profiles to be similar to circulating plasma progesterone profiles. Fecal immunoreactive progestagen analysis resulted in a marked immunoreactive peak of progesterone. The data from the single killer whale indicate that the measurement of rectal temperature is suitable for minimally invasive assessment of the estrous cycle and monitoring the fecal progesterone concentration is useful to assess ovarian luteal activity.

SO ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB Marta J. Cremer, Fernando A.S. Hardt, Antonio J. Tonello Jr, and Paulo Cesar Simoes-Lopes (2011) Distribution and status of the Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis (Cetacea, Delphinidae) population in Babitonga Bay, southern Brazil. Zoological Studies 50(3): 327-337. The Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis is one of the most endangered small cetaceans in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The population abundance and density of this species were estimated in Babitonga Bay in 2000-2003. Sampling was random and stratified, and a line transect method with distance sampling was applied in an area of 160 km(2). The total length of transects covered was 1251.9 km, with 163 groups of dolphins recorded. Group sizes varied 2-30 (mean, 5.3; SD, 5.6) individuals. Some areas were preferred by the population, and area 3 was considered the core area of S. guianensis in Babitonga Bay. The abundance was estimated to be 245 (95% confidence interval (CI): 142-422) individuals between Dec. 2000 and Nov. 2001, 186 (95% CI: 93-374) individuals between Apr. 2002 and Feb. 2003, and 179 (95% CI: 93-344) individuals between Mar. and Dec. 2003, and the densities were estimated at 1.6 (95% CI: 1-2.7), 1.2 (95% CI: 0.6-2.4), and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.5-3.4) individuals/km(2), respectively. The highest density was recorded in the central area of the bay. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.3/327.pdf

TI Accumulation of butyltin compounds in cetaceans from Korean coastal
   waters
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Data on the occurrence and accumulation profiles of butyltins (BTs), including tributyltin (TBT), in marine mammals are scarce. This is the first study to investigate residue levels and accumulation patterns of BTs in cetaceans from Korean coastal waters. The total concentrations of BTs (sum of mono- to tri-butyltins) in minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus capensis) ranged from 15.7 to 297 ng/g wet weight (mean: 100 ng/g wet weight) and from 59.0 to 412 ng/g wet weight (mean: 228 ng/g wet weight), respectively. Dibutyltin (DBT) accounted for 63% of the total BTs in all cetacean samples. Significant species-specific differences in BT concentrations, possibly due to the differences in their habitat and diet, were found between the two cetacean species. The concentrations of DBT and TBT in most cetacean samples exceeded the threshold value for cytotoxic effects in cetaceans, implying potentially adverse health risks from exposure to BTs.

TI Dolphins and coastal fisheries within a marine protected area: mismatch
   between dolphin occurrence and reported depredation
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Dolphins are often blamed for reducing fisheries catches and may be killed in retaliation. Depredation of fishing gear in coastal Mediterranean waters is normally caused by bottlenose dolphins. Economic impact, however, may be modest even within areas of reportedly acute conflict.
   2. Boat surveys and interviews were conducted to investigate dolphin occurrence and interactions with fisheries within the 167km(2) Porto Cesareo Marine Protected Area (MPA) in southern Italy. Based on 69 interviews with fishermen using bottom-set trammel and gill nets, there was reportedly a high occurrence of depredation by bottlenose dolphins. Depredation was reported by 92% of the fishermen operating in or near the MPA, and 67% of them claimed an economic cost in excess of (sic)1000 per year, with a mean reported cost of (sic)2561: a higher impact than in other Mediterranean studies.
   3. According to local fishermen, dolphin occurrence and depredation peaked in spring and autumn, coincident with the study's surveys at sea. Dedicated visual surveys totalling 1255km of effort, however, resulted in no encounters with cetaceans. Information from interviews and boat surveys was therefore contradictory, suggesting that reports of acute depredation do not imply a constant presence of dolphins within the MPA.
   4. While depredation in the MPA might be caused by wide-ranging dolphins or incursions occurring overnight, damage may well be overestimated or over-reported. As local fishermen had previously benefited from subsidies, interviews made during this study could be perceived by some as an opportunity to influence future decision-making regarding monetary compensation for the impact of depredation.
   5. Evidence from interviews also indicated that species and factors other than dolphins were responsible for part of the damage. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Using bycatch data to understand habitat use of small cetaceans: lessons
   from an experimental driftnet fishery
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Many marine mammals inhabit offshore areas where it is difficult to determine distribution and abundance. Historical bycatch data of marine mammals in the Northwest Atlantic obtained from the Canadian experimental Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) driftnet fishery were examined to obtain information on seasonal distribution and relative abundance. From 1965 to 2001, 47 cruises were undertaken totalling 12 566.5 km-h of fishing effort; four species of small cetacean and two species of pinniped were caught. Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were the most frequently caught species in all areas except the Labrador Sea, where Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) were more common. Long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas), common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were also taken occasionally. Although typically considered an inshore species, harbour porpoises were regularly reported in deep water (> 2000 m), in the Newfoundland Basin and Labrador Sea. Atlantic white-sided dolphins were often caught along the edge of the continental shelf and appeared to prefer relatively warm water. Finally, catch records indicate that waters of the Newfoundland Basin and Southern Grand Banks may contain important winter habitat for several small species of cetacean.

TI Evolution of 2 Reproductive Proteins, ZP3 and PKDREJ, in Cetaceans
SO JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
AB The rapid evolution of proteins involved in reproduction has been documented in several animal taxa. This is thought to be the result of forces involved in sexual selection and is expected to be particularly strong in promiscuous mating systems. In this study, a range of cetacean species were used to analyze the patterns of evolution in 2 reproductive proteins involved in fertilization: the zona pellucida 3 (ZP3), present in the egg coat, and PKDREJ, localized in the sperm head. We targeted exons 6 and 7 of ZP3 and a part of the REJ domain in PKDREJ for a total of 958 bp in 18 species. We found very low levels of amino acid sequence divergence in both proteins, a very weak signal of positive selection in ZP3 and no signal in PKDREJ. These results were consistent with previous reports of a slow rate of molecular evolution in cetaceans but unexpected due to the existence of promiscuous mating systems in these species. The results raise questions about the evolution of reproductive isolation and species recognition in whales and dolphins.

TI A review of developments towards biologically inspired propulsion
   systems for autonomous underwater vehicles
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART M-JOURNAL OF
   ENGINEERING FOR THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are playing an ever-growing role in modern subocean operations, generating a demand for faster, more manoeuvrable designs capable of deployments of increasingly longer durations. In order to meet these demands, vehicle developers have been looking to biological aquatic animals for inspiration. After evolving for millions of years, fish and cetaceans have developed fast efficient locomotion techniques, with levels of manoeuvrability that far outperform conventional engineered marine locomotion systems. This paper aims to give a brief introduction into some of the biologically inspired propulsion mechanisms that have been developed, to explain their strengths, their weaknesses, and the motivation behind them, and then finally to predict future trends in bio-mimetic AUV propulsion design.

TI Dynamic Horizontal Cultural Transmission of Humpback Whale Song at the
   Ocean Basin Scale
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB Cultural transmission, the social learning of information or behaviors from conspecifics [1-5], is believed to occur in a number of groups of animals, including primates [1, 6-9], cetaceans [4, 10, 11], and birds [3, 12, 13]. Cultural traits can be passed vertically (from parents to offspring), obliquely (from the previous generation via a nonparent model to younger individuals), or horizontally (between unrelated individuals from similar age classes or within generations) [4]. Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have a highly stereotyped, repetitive, and progressively evolving vocal sexual display or "song" [14-17] that functions in sexual selection (through mate attraction and/or male social sorting) [18-20]. All males within a population conform to the current version of the display (song type), and similarities may exist among the songs of populations within an ocean basin [16, 17, 21]. Here we present a striking pattern of horizontal transmission: multiple song types spread rapidly and repeatedly in a unidirectional manner, like cultural ripples, eastward through the populations in the western and central South Pacific over an 11-year period. This is the first documentation of a repeated, dynamic cultural change occurring across multiple populations at such a large geographic scale.

TI A supermatrix analysis of genomic, morphological, and paleontological
   data from crown Cetacea
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB Background: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises, and whales) is a clade of aquatic species that includes the most massive, deepest diving, and largest brained mammals. Understanding the temporal pattern of diversification in the group as well as the evolution of cetacean anatomy and behavior requires a robust and well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis. Although a large body of molecular data has accumulated over the past 20 years, DNA sequences of cetaceans have not been directly integrated with the rich, cetacean fossil record to reconcile discrepancies among molecular and morphological characters.
   Results: We combined new nuclear DNA sequences, including segments of six genes (similar to 2800 basepairs) from the functionally extinct Yangtze River dolphin, with an expanded morphological matrix and published genomic data. Diverse analyses of these data resolved the relationships of 74 taxa that represent all extant families and 11 extinct families of Cetacea. The resulting supermatrix (61,155 characters) and its sub-partitions were analyzed using parsimony methods. Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) searches were conducted on the molecular partition, and a molecular scaffold obtained from these searches was used to constrain a parsimony search of the morphological partition. Based on analysis of the supermatrix and model-based analyses of the molecular partition, we found overwhelming support for 15 extant clades. When extinct taxa are included, we recovered trees that are significantly correlated with the fossil record. These trees were used to reconstruct the timing of cetacean diversification and the evolution of characters shared by "river dolphins," a non-monophyletic set of species according to all of our phylogenetic analyses.
   Conclusions: The parsimony analysis of the supermatrix and the analysis of morphology constrained to fit the ML/Bayesian molecular tree yielded broadly congruent phylogenetic hypotheses. In trees from both analyses, all Oligocene taxa included in our study fell outside crown Mysticeti and crown Odontoceti, suggesting that these two clades radiated in the late Oligocene or later, contra some recent molecular clock studies. Our trees also imply that many character states shared by river dolphins evolved in their oceanic ancestors, contradicting the hypothesis that these characters are convergent adaptations to fluvial habitats.

TI A quarter of a world away: female humpback whale moves 10 000 km between
   breeding areas
SO BIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Fidelity of individual animals to breeding sites is a primary determinant of population structure. The degree and scale of philopatry in a population reflect the fitness effects of social facilitation, ecological adaptation and optimal inbreeding. Patterns of breeding-site movement and fidelity are functions of social structure and are frequently sex biased. We report on a female humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) first identified by natural markings off Brazil that subsequently was photographed off Madagascar. The minimum travel distance between these locations is greater than 9800 km, approximately 4000 km longer than any previously reported movement between breeding grounds, more than twice the species' typical seasonal migratory distance and the longest documented movement by a mammal. It is unexpected to find this exceptional long-distance movement between breeding groups by a female, as models of philopatry suggest that male mammals move more frequently or over longer distances in search of mating opportunities. While such movement may be advantageous, especially in changeable or unpredictable circumstances, it is not possible to unambiguously ascribe causality to this rare observation. This finding illustrates the behavioural flexibility in movement patterns that may be demonstrated within a typically philopatric species.

TI Phylogenetic analysis of marine mammal herpesviruses
SO VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB Five novel DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Dpol) herpesviral sequences were generated using nested consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinical samples from a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), orca (Orcinus orca), California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), and a Phocid herpesvirus 2 (PhHV-2) isolate from a harbor seal (used as positive control). These novel sequences and other representative herpesvirus sequences were included in Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses to illustrate the phylogeny of herpesviruses amongst the marine mammal host species and in comparison to those of other animals. All 19 novel and known marine mammal herpesviruses included in the analyses aligned with members of the Alpha herpesvirinae or Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. The novel harbor seal herpesvirus clustered with members of the Macavirus genus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. The novel bottlenose dolphin herpesvirus clustered together in a monophyletic group with another delphinid alphaherpesvirus but could not be associated with an established genus. The orca herpesvirus also clustered with a delphinid alphaherpesvirus and formed a separate clade. The sea lion herpesvirus clustered with PhHV-2. PhHV-1 clustered with varicelloviruses and PhHV-2 clustered strongly in the Gammaherpesvirinae genus Percavirus. All cetacean gammaherpesviruses formed a monophyletic clade and could not be associated with an established gammaherpesviral genus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Phylogeny and adaptive evolution of the brain-development gene
   microcephalin (MCPH1) in cetaceans
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB Background: Representatives of Cetacea have the greatest absolute brain size among animals, and the largest relative brain size aside from humans. Despite this, genes implicated in the evolution of large brain size in primates have yet to be surveyed in cetaceans.
   Results: We sequenced similar to 1240 basepairs of the brain development gene microcephalin (MCPH1) in 38 cetacean species. Alignments of these data and a published complete sequence from Tursiops truncatus with primate MCPH1 were utilized in phylogenetic analyses and to estimate. (rate of nonsynonymous substitution/rate of synonymous substitution) using site and branch models of molecular evolution. We also tested the hypothesis that selection on MCPH1 was correlated with brain size in cetaceans using a continuous regression analysis that accounted for phylogenetic history. Our analyses revealed widespread signals of adaptive evolution in the MCPH1 of Cetacea and in other subclades of Mammalia, however, there was not a significant positive association between. and brain size within Cetacea.
   Conclusion: In conjunction with a recent study of Primates, we find no evidence to support an association between MCPH1 evolution and the evolution of brain size in highly encephalized mammalian species. Our finding of significant positive selection in MCPH1 may be linked to other functions of the gene.

TI Estimating the success of protected areas for the vaquita, Phocoena
   sinus
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Bycatch in artisanal gill nets threatens the vaquita, Phocoena sinus, with extinction. In 2008 the Mexican government announced a conservation action plan for this porpoise, with three options for a protected area closed to gill net fishing. The probability of success of each of the three options was estimated with a Bayesian population model, where success was defined as an increase in vaquita abundance after 10 yr. The model was fitted to data on abundance, bycatch, and fishing effort, although data were sparse and imprecise. Under the first protected area option, the existing Refuge Area for the Protection of the Vaquita, bycatch was about 7% of population size, and probability of success was 0.08. Under the second option with a larger protected area, the probability of success was 0.35. The third option was large enough to eliminate vaquita bycatch and had a probability of success > 0.99. Probability of success was reduced if elimination of vaquita bycatch was delayed or incomplete. Despite considerable efforts by the Mexican government to support vaquita conservation, abundance will probably continue to decline unless additional measures to reduce vaquita bycatch are taken, such as banning gill nets within the vaquita's range and developing effective alternative fishing gear.

TI West Africa's Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii): endemic,
   enigmatic and soon Endangered?
SO AFRICAN ZOOLOGY
AB Atlantic humpback dolphins (Sousa teuszii) are endemic to nearshore West African waters between Western Sahara and Angola. They are considered Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature based on restricted geographic range, low abundance and apparent decline in recent decades. We review the human activities most likely to affect the species and consider appropriate conservation actions. Bycatch (incidental capture) in gillnets is the greatest immediate threat. Deaths from entanglement have been documented in Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and the Republic of the Congo. In Namibe Province, Angola, 4.8 artisanal fishing boats and two gillnets per km were observed in some areas within 1 km of the coast and gillnets are deployed regularly inside bays used by dolphins. Other concerns include the 'marine bushmeat' trade, habitat loss/degradation, overfishing, marine pollution, anthropogenic sound and climate change. Conservation challenges include a paucity of scientific data on the species, and widespread human poverty within most range states, resulting in high dependence on artisanal fisheries. Recommended conservation and research priorities include: (1) distribution and abundance surveys in known and potential range states, (2) bycatch monitoring programmes, (3) education/awareness schemes, and (4) protection of core areas via reduction/elimination of nearshore gillnetting.

TI INSIGHTS USING A MOLECULAR APPROACH INTO THE LIFE CYCLE OF A TAPEWORM
   INFECTING GREAT WHITE SHARKS
SO JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB The great white shark Carcharodon carcharias Linnaeus, 1758 is a versatile and fierce predator (and responsible for many shark attacks on humans). This apex predator feeds on a wide range of organisms including teleosts, other elasmobranchs, cephalopods, pinnipeds, and cetaceans. Although much is known about its diet, no trophic links have been empirically identified as being involved in the transmission of its tapeworm parasites. Recently, the use of molecular tools combined with phylogenetics has proven useful to identify larval and immature stages of marine tapeworms; utilization of the technique has been increasing rapidly. However, the usefulness of this approach remains limited by the availability of molecular data. Here, I employed gene sequence data from the D2 region of the large subunit of ribosomal DNA to link adults of the tapeworm Clistobothrium carcharodoni Dailey and Vogelbein, 1990 (Cestoda: Tetraphyllidea) to larvae for which sequence data for this gene are available. The sequences from the adult tapeworms were genetically identical (0% sequence divergence) to those available on GenBank for "SP" 'small' Scolex pleuronectis recovered from the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). This study is the first to provide empirical evidence linking the trophic interaction between great white sharks and cetaceans as a definitive route for the successful transmission of a tetraphyllidean tapeworm. Using the intensity of infection data from this shark and from cetaceans as proxies for the extent of predation, I estimate that this individual shark would have consumed between 9 to 83 G. griseus, fresh, dead, or both, in its lifetime.

TI Cytochrome P450 isozyme protein verified in the skin of southern
   hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae): Implications for
   biochemical biomarker assessment
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Large mysticete whales represent a unique challenge for chemical risk assessment. Few epidemiological investigations are possible due to the low incidence of adult stranding events. Similarly their often extreme life-history adaptations of prolonged migration and fasting challenge exposure assumptions. Molecular biomarkers offer the potential to complement information yielded through tissue chemical analysis, as well as providing evidence of a molecular response to chemical exposure. In this study we confirm the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A1 (CYP1A1) in epidermal tissue of southern hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The detection of CYP1A1 in the integument of the humpback whale affords the opportunity for further quantitative non-destructive investigations of enzyme activity as a function of chemical stress.

TI Microsatellite data reveal fine genetic structure in male Guiana
   dolphins (Sotalia guianesis) in two geographically close embayments at
   south-eastern coast of Brazil
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
AB A large macrogeographic differentiation has been observed among Sotalia guianensis populations along the South American coast. However, no genetic structure has been detected so far in closely distributed populations of this species, even though it has been observed in other cetaceans. Here, we examined the fine scale population structure for the largest populations of S. guianensis inhabiting Sepetiba and Paraty embayments at the southeastern coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences failed to detect variability among sequences. Conversely, evidence of significant male population structure was found on the basis of ten nuclear microsatellite loci. Surprisingly, the microsatellite markers were able to distinguish between individuals from the two embayments located 60 km apart. The results suggest that differences in habitat type and behavioral specializations are likely to explain the patterns of genetic structure. These findings should provide baselines for the management of communities exposed to increasing human-driven habitat loss.

TI Olfaction and brain size in the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus)
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Although there are several isolated references to the olfactory anatomy of mysticetes, it is usually thought that olfaction is rudimentary in this group. We investigated the olfactory anatomy of bowhead whales and found that these whales have a cribriform plate and small, but histologically complex olfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb makes up approximately 0.13% of brain weight, unlike odontocetes where this structure is absent. We also determined that 51% of olfactory receptor genes were intact, unlike odontocetes, where this number is less than 25%. This suggests that bowheads have a sense of smell, and we speculate that they may use this to find aggregations of krill on which they feed.

TI Extreme physiological adaptations as predictors of climate-change
   sensitivity in the narwhal, Monodon monoceros
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Rapid changes in sea ice cover associated with global warming are poised to have marked impacts on polar marine mammals. Here we examine skeletal muscle characteristics supporting swimming and diving in one polar species, the narwhal, and use these attributes to further document this cetacean's vulnerability to unpredictable sea ice conditions and changing ecosystems. We found that extreme morphological and physiological adaptations enabling year-round Arctic residency by narwhals limit behavioral flexibility for responding to alternations in sea ice. In contrast to the greyhound-like muscle profile of acrobatic odontocetes, the longissimus dorsi of narwhals is comprised of 86.8% +/- 7.7% slow twitch oxidative fibers, resembling the endurance morph of human marathoners. Myoglobin content, 7.87 +/- 1.72 g/100 g wet muscle, is one of the highest levels measured for marine mammals. Calculated maximum aerobic swimming distance between breathing holes in ice is < 1,450 m, which permits routine use of only 2.6%-10.4% of ice-packed foraging grounds in Baffin Bay. These first measurements of narwhal exercise physiology reveal extreme specialization of skeletal muscles for moving in a challenging ecological niche. This study also demonstrates the power of using basic physiological attributes to predict species vulnerabilities to environmental perturbation before critical population disturbance occurs.

TI Vertebral and rib anatomy in Caperea marginata: Implications for
   evolutionary patterning of the mammalian vertebral column
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>The pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata, is a rare mysticete cetacean with an unusual suite of axial skeletal characters. Distally expanded first ribs, a long thorax with broadly overlapping vertebral transverse processes, plate-like posterior ribs, and a short tail contrast with other cetaceans and suggest unique developmental patterning. Twenty-four individuals of diverse ontogenetic age were available for analysis. Multiple, variable examples of incomplete rib fusion in dependent calves indicate that the first rib of adults is an ontogenetic fusion product of ribs 1 and 2. The composite rib articulates by way of its anterior (Rib1) component to the sternum and by way of its posterior (Rib2) component with thoracic vertebra 2. Thoracic vertebra 1 lacks rib articulations. When rib fusion is taken into account, the most frequent column formulas are C7T18L1Cd16-17 = 42-43 and C7T17L1Cd16-18 = 41-43. Thoracic and lumbar series are not reciprocal in count, arguing against their developmental linkage. Instead, parallel reduction in both lumbar and caudal counts supports the existence of neocete patterning in Caperea, as in all other living cetaceans. Ontogenetic vertebral column elongation is most marked in the posterior thorax, lumbos, and anterior tail. Vertebrae in these column regions are excellent predictors of total body length.

TI Distribution of Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) off the west
   coast, South Island, New Zealand, with implications for the management
   of bycatch
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>To support decision making on placement of protected areas for Hector's dolphin on New Zealand's South Island west coast, we conducted three aerial surveys documenting the species' distribution in this area. The first survey was designed to quantify alongshore distribution and abundance, and revealed a patchy distribution with a central zone of high density. Two further surveys, in summer and winter, focused on this central zone to quantify offshore distribution in detail. Dolphin density decreased with increasing distance offshore, with no dolphins sighted more than 6 nmi from the coast or in water deeper than 60 m. There was no significant difference in offshore distribution between summer and winter surveys conducted in 2003 (G = 2.15, df = 5, P = 0.83). Partial Mantel tests showed that dolphin distribution was best explained by distance from the coast, in both summer (r(M) = 0.088, P = 0.0001) and winter (r(M) = 0.054, P = 0.0004). Spatial contouring techniques showed that small (ca. 5 km) and medium scale (ca. 50 km) patterns of density in the central zone were remarkably consistent, suggesting year-round residency. Based on these data, the current restrictions on commercial gillnetting protect 60% or less of the dolphin population for 3 mo of the year.

TI Insights from life history traits of Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus)
   in Taiwanese waters: Shorter body length characterizes northwest Pacific
   population
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) are widely distributed throughout temperate to tropical pelagic waters of the world and are one of the most frequently encountered cetaceans in eastern Taiwanese coastal waters. Because their life history is poorly known, the goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between age, body length, and sexual maturity of Risso's dolphins in Taiwanese waters. Ninety-two carcasses of dead-stranded or fisheries bycaught dolphins (1994-2008) were measured and dissected (total body length, TBL 125-290 cm); sexual maturity was assessed in 33 dolphins; and age was estimated by counting dentinal growth layer groups in routine histologically prepared tooth sections of 28 dolphins. Sexual dimorphism in TBL was not detected. The onset of sexual maturity occurred at 240-255 cm in females and 253-265 cm in males, which was at about 10 yr of age for both sexes. Our stranding, bycatch, and previous boat survey records suggest that Risso's dolphins occur year-round and likely have a summer-fall calving season in Taiwanese waters. The similar life history parameters and calving season in dolphins from Taiwanese and Japanese waters suggest a common population in the northwest Pacific, which has a noticeably shorter body length than in other regions.

TI Life-history tables of the Mediterranean fin whale from stranding data
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB The conservation of long-lived species requires extensive, in-depth knowledge of their population structure and vital rates. In this paper we examine the structure of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) population based on the available mortality figures from European stranding network databases compiled over the past 22 years. Such data has enabled us to lay out a first life-history (mortality) table of the population using a simple age-structured demographic model with three life-tables: calf, immature and mature. Our results reveal a high mortality rate in the first stage of life (77% per year), which decreases during the immature stage and falls further during the mature adult stage. In addition, we have calculated the corresponding life expectancies at birth (e(0)), at entry in the immature stage (e(1)) and at maturity (e(2)) under different hypotheses on survival at the maximum age of 90 years (s(90)) ranging between 0.1 and 3% of newborns still alive. The life expectancy at birth (e(0)) at the lower bound of the chosen range (s(90) = 0.001) is about 6 years, entry in the immature stage (e(1)) is 8.2 years, and entry in the mature stage (e(2)) is about 15.6 years. This large increase is the consequence of the higher mortality in the first two stages compared with the mature one. The life expectancies are 10.1, 14.3, and 37.8 years for s(90) at the upper bound of the chosen range (s(90) = 0.03). The resulting population intrinsic growth rates (r) ranged between) -1.3. and +1.7 per year. High juvenile mortality patterns imply that the stationary reproductive value (the number of female offspring produced by each female after a given age x) at the start of maturity reaches a value about seven times higher than at birth. Only optimistically high survival patterns of older individuals would allow positive intrinsic growth rates, thereby enhancing the chances of the population survival.

TI Molecular characterization and phylogeny of anisakid nematodes from
   cetaceans from southeastern Atlantic coasts of USA, Gulf of Mexico, and
   Caribbean Sea
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB In the present study, 407 anisakid nematodes, collected from 11 different species of cetaceans of the families Delphinidae, Kogiidae, Physeteridae, and Ziphiidae, from the southeastern Atlantic coasts of USA, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea, were examined morphologically and genetically characterized by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism to identify them to species level, assess their relative frequencies in definitive hosts, and determine any host preference. Sequence data from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and mitochondrial cox2 genes were analysed by maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods, as separate and combined datasets, to evaluate phylogenetic relationships among taxa. The results revealed a highly diverse ascaridoid community. Seven Anisakis species and Pseudoterranova species were recovered as adult parasites. Larval forms of Contracaecum multipapillatum were also found in a coastal population of bottlenose dolphins. The phylogenetic trees obtained from the combined dataset (and most individual datasets) revealed the existence of distinct clades, the first including species of the Anisakis simplex complex (A. simplex s.s., Anisakis pegreffii, A. simplex C), (Anisakis nascettii, Anisakis ziphidarum) and the second including Pseudoterranova ceticola ((Anisakis paggiae, (Anisakis physeteris, Anisakis brevispiculata)). This finding, excluding the relationship of P. ceticola, is consistent with the morphology of adult and larval specimens. Considering the presence versus absence of an intestinal cecum, the relationship of P. ceticola with the members of the second clade of Anisakis appears inconsistent with morphological evidences but consistent with host preference. The position of Anisakis typica as the sister group to the two main anisakid clades indicates that it represents a third distinct lineage.

TI Phylogenetic analysis of a new Cetacean morbillivirus from a
   short-finned pilot whale stranded in the Canary Islands
SO RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is considered the most pathogenic virus in cetaceans. Three strains have been already described: the dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), the porpoise morbillivirus (PMV) and the tentatively named pilot whale morbillivirus (PWMV).
   This study describes the molecular characterization of a strain of CeMV detected in the brain of a short-finned pilot whale that had stranded in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean around the Canary Islands and that showed lesions compatible with morbilliviral disease. Sequences for the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, fusion protein and haemagglutinin genes were obtained. The phylogenetic study showed high homology (97%) with the PWMV strain previously detected from a long-finned pilot whale stranded in the Western Atlantic Ocean. These results support the existing classification of CeMV into three principal genetic clusters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Reproductive cycles of marine mammals
SO ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB Marine mammals conform to the general mammalian reproductive system centered on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Most marine mammals are long-lived and of large body size with lesser reproductive rates than many other animals, a consequence of their interaction with the marine environment where the demands of acquiring resources from the ocean must be balanced with the need for bearing offspring in a suitable place for survival. The degree of spatial and temporal separation of these life history phases in many species is a key feature of their ecology. The reproductive physiology of pinnipeds, cetaceans, sirenians, sea otters and polar bears has been more thoroughly characterized for the more accessible species.

TI Aerial audiograms of several California sea lions (Zalophus

   single and multiple simultaneous auditory steady-state response methods
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Measurements of the electrophysiological auditory steady-state response (ASSR) have proven to be efficient for evaluating hearing sensitivity in odontocete cetaceans. In an effort to expand these methods to pinnipeds, ASSRs elicited by single and multiple simultaneous tones were used to measure aerial hearing thresholds in several California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). There were no significant differences between thresholds measured using the single and multiple ASSR methods, despite the more rapid nature of data collection using the multiple ASSR method. There was a high degree of variability in ASSR thresholds among subjects; thresholds covered a range of similar to 40. dB at each tested frequency. As expected, ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to previously reported psychophysical thresholds for California and Steller sea lions. The features of high-frequency hearing limit and relative sensitivity of most ASSR audiograms were, however, similar to those of psychophysical audiograms, suggesting that ASSR methods can be used to improve understanding of hearing demographics in sea lions, especially with respect to high-frequency hearing. Thresholds for one Steller sea lion were substantially elevated relative to all other subjects, demonstrating that ASSR methods can be used to detect hearing loss in sea lions.

SO ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
AB During January and February 2004, data on presence and distribution of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and other cetaceans were collected by helicopter surveys along the coastline of Terra Nova Bay and adjacent localities (western Ross Sea, Antarctica). A total of 37 sightings of killer whale, of both B and C types, were recorded as well as 17 sightings of Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), nine of Balaenoptera spp., two of Arnoux's beaked whale (Berardius arnuxii) and four of undetermined species. The type C killer whale was the most abundant, with 23 sightings, whereas we recorded type B only twice. Group size ranged between 1 and 30 animals, with an average of eight individuals. Seventeen killer whales were photo-identified and 13 resightings occurred during the study period. Killer whales showed a differential pattern in partitioning the study area. Their encounter rate was significantly higher (t-test = 2.6045, P < 0.05) in the northern area extending from Edmonson Point to the Campbell Glacier Tongue (encounter rate, ER = 0.031), compared to the southern area from Mario Zucchelli Station to the Drygalski Ice Tongue (ER = 0.003).

TI Inshore cetaceans from the North and South Pacific coast of Costa Rica
SO REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB Inshore cetaceans from the North and South Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Twenty nine cetacean species occur in Costa Rican waters but extensive research has been conducted only for three specie The latter shows there is a lack of general and local information about these mammals, even when the country, has shown a remarkable growth in whale watching activities. The increasing use of marine resources in coastal areas has also developed the need to determine the occurrence of cetaceans in areas showing high tourist presence, in order to propose sound conservation measures. In this study, environmental variables were determined and subsequently related to the presence of the species recorded, out of 166 sightings, between 2005 and 2006. The species with highest proportion of sightings were Stenella attenuata (68%), followed by Megaptera novaeangliae (13%) and Tursiops truncatus (10%). The presence of spotted dolphins is related to changes in salinity and water transparency, while that of the humpback whale was related to wave height (Beaufort scale) and water temperature. The presence of seven species of cetaceans was confirmed in two coastal areas of the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, from which three are present throughout the year. Environmental variables were found related to the presence of at least two species. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (1): 283-290. Epub 2011 March 01.

TI Reproductive success of male Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella
   frontalis) revealed by noninvasive genetic analysis of paternity
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE
AB Cetaceans are known to frequently engage in sexual behavior; however, the lack of male parental investment in offspring makes assessment of male reproductive success difficult. We assessed paternity in a small population (mean individuals sighted per year = 93) of Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis (G. Cuvier, 1829)) utilizing noninvasively collected fecal material. Samples (n = 88) were collected from dolphins from four social clusters. Of the 29 offspring tested, 34.5% were assigned paternity, resulting in 10 paternities assigned to seven males. Our study indicates that achieving a certain age is a potential precursor for males to mate successfully, as 18 years was the youngest estimated age of a male at the time of calf conception. In all pairings but one, the males were older than the female (mean age difference = 7.7+ years). Successful males were from two of the four social clusters and males most often mated within their social group or with females from the next geographically closest group. The study combines genetic data with known maternal pedigree information and reveals patterns in the overall mating system in a cetacean species where reproductive success of males was previously unknown.

AB Long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra), Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Sowerby's beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps) make up the large community of deep-diving odontocetes occurring off the Bay of Biscay, northeast Atlantic. The ecology of these toothed cetaceans is poorly documented worldwide. The present study described their prey preferences from stomach content analysis and showed resource partitioning within the assemblage. The majority of the species appeared to be mostly teutophageous. Fish was an important food source only for the Sowerby's beaked whale and, to a lesser extent, for the long-finned pilot whale. In terms of foraging habitats inferred from prey composition, either pelagic oceanic or demersal neritic habitats were exploited by toothed whales in the Bay of Biscay, with only the long-finned pilot whale foraging in the two habitats. Finally, with more than 14,000 identified cephalopods from 39 species, the present study highlighted also the poorly known deep-sea cephalopod community off the Bay of Biscay using top predators as biological samplers.

TI Pacific Ocean-Wide Profile of CYP1A1 Expression, Stable Carbon and
   Nitrogen Isotope Ratios, and Organic Contaminant Burden in Sperm Whale
   Skin Biopsies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Ocean pollution affects marine organisms and ecosystems as well as humans. The International Oceanographic Commission recommends ocean health monitoring programs to investigate the presence of marine contaminants and the health of threatened species and the use of multiple and early-warning biomarker approaches.
   OBJECTIVE: We explored the hypothesis that biomarker and contaminant analyses in skin biopsies of the threatened sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) could reveal geographical trends in exposure on an ocean-wide scale.
   METHODS: We analyzed cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression (by immunohistochemistry), stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios (as general indicators of trophic position and latitude, respectively), and contaminant burdens in skin biopsies to explore regional trends in the Pacific Ocean.
   RESULTS: Biomarker analyses revealed significant regional differences within the Pacific Ocean. CYP1A1 expression was highest in whales from the Galapagos, a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization World Heritage marine reserve, and was lowest in the sampling sites farthest away from continents. We examined the possible influence of the whales' sex, diet, or range and other parameters on regional variation in CYP1A1 expression, but data were inconclusive. In general, CYP1A1 expression was not significantly correlated with contaminant burdens in blubber. However, small sample sizes precluded detailed chemical analyses, and power to detect significant associations was limited.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our large-scale monitoring study was successful at identifying regional differences in CYP1A1 expression, providing a baseline for this known biomarker of exposure to aryl hydro-carbon receptor agonists. However, we could not identify factors that explained this variation. Future ocean-wide CYP1A1 expression profiles in cetacean skin biopsies are warranted and could reveal whether globally distributed chemicals occur at biochemically relevant concentrations on a global basis, which may provide a measure of ocean integrity.

TI Live CT imaging of sound reception anatomy and hearing measurements in
   the pygmy killer whale, Feresa attenuata
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB In June 2008, two pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata) were stranded alive near Boca Grande, FL, USA, and were taken into rehabilitation. We used this opportunity to learn about the peripheral anatomy of the auditory system and hearing sensitivity of these rare toothed whales. Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of head structures from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images revealed mandibles that were hollow, lacked a bony lamina medial to the pan bone and contained mandibular fat bodies that extended caudally and abutted the tympanoperiotic complex. Using auditory evoked potential (AEP) procedures, the modulation rate transfer function was determined. Maximum evoked potential responses occurred at modulation frequencies of 500 and 1000. Hz. The AEP-derived audiograms were U-shaped. The lowest hearing thresholds occurred between 20 and 60. kHz, with the best hearing sensitivity at 40. kHz. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was composed of seven waves and resembled the ABR of the bottlenose and common dolphins. By changing electrode locations, creating 3-D reconstructions of the brain from CT images and measuring the amplitude of the ABR waves, we provided evidence that the neuroanatomical sources of ABR waves I, IV and VI were the auditory nerve, inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, respectively. The combination of AEP testing and CT imaging provided a new synthesis of methods for studying the auditory system of cetaceans.

TI Host specificity of Oschmarinella rochebruni and Brachycladium
   atlanticum (Digenea: Brachycladiidae) in five cetacean species from
   western Mediterranean waters
SO JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY
AB We investigated patterns of specificity of liver flukes (fam. Brachycladiidae) in a community of cetaceans from the western Mediterranean. The liver and pancreas of 103 striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, 18 Risso's dolphins, Grampus griseus, 14 bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, 8 common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, and 5 long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas, were analysed for brachycladiid species. Two species were found: Oschmarinella rochebruni in striped dolphins (prevalence (P): 61.2%; mean intensity (MI) (95% CI): 34.2 (25.7-45.6)), and Brachycladium atlanticum in striped dolphins (P: 39.8%; MI: 7.1 (4.8-13.1)) and a single individual of common dolphin (P: 12.5%; intensity: 19), which represents a new host record. A molecular analysis using the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the rDNA gene confirmed that specimens of B. atlanticum were conspecific regardless of host species. Available dietary data suggest that Risso's dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and long-finned pilot whales would contact rarely, if at all, the infective stages of O. rochebruni and B. atlanticum. Neither the prevalence nor the mean abundance of B. atlanticum differed significantly between striped and common dolphins, but a principal component analysis using seven morphometric variables indicated that specimens collected from the common dolphin were stunted. These worms also had fewer eggs compared with specimens typically found in striped dolphins, although the size of the eggs was similar in both host species. Dwarfism and low fecundity have typically been found in helminths infecting unusual host species, and might reflect the lower compatibility of B. atlanticum for common dolphins. In summary, both O. rochebruni and B. atlanticum appear to exhibit a narrow specificity for striped dolphins in the western Mediterranean.

TI Characterization of Alpha-fetoprotein in Fetal Striped Dolphin (Stenella
   coeruleoalba): Purification of Protein Product and Molecular Cloning of
   the Corresponding Transcript
SO ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a fetal glycoprotein that is known as a biomarker for monitoring pregnancy in many mammalian species. However, characterization of AFP has not yet been undertaken in any cetacean species. Here, we purified AFP from the serum of fetal striped dolphin by chemical precipitation followed by a combination of immunoadsorbent column chromatography and gel filtration. The molecular masses of native and denatured dolphin AFP were estimated to be similar to 78,000 Da by gel filtration and similar to 68,000 Da by SDS-PAGE, respectively, representing typical masses reported for mammalian AFPs. In fetal serum, only the AFP band (similar to 68,000 Da) appeared to be immunoreactive to an antiserum against purified dolphin AFP, indicating sufficient specificity for the development of an AFP immunoassay. Full-length cDNA encoding for the dolphin AFP was cloned from fetal liver and revealed an open reading frame comprising 610 amino acid residues, which included a putative signal peptide of 18 amino acid residues. This was followed by a sequence identical to the N-terminus of purified AFP. The deduced amino acid sequence of dolphin AFP showed more than 80% identity to those of other mammalian AFPs. To our knowledge, the present report represents the first identification and characterization of AFP from any cetacean species.

TI Mitochondrial DNA diversity and PCR-based sex determination of Irrawaddy
   dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) from Chilika Lagoon, India
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Of the only known two Lagoon populations of Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella) in the world, one is residing in the Chilika Lagoon in Orissa state, India. In addition to accidental deaths in gill net fishery and mechanized boat operations, there has been exploitation of the species for their oil. Extreme patchy distribution and vulnerability to becoming entangled in fishing gear has made it a focus of conservation concern. Information on genetic diversity of populations has considerable potential for informing conservation plans. The present paper reports the first genetic study of O. brevirostris from Chilika Lagoon based on mtDNA sequencing and PCR-based sex identification from 11 individuals. Control region sequence comparison showed two haplotypes and cytochrome b a single haplotype in the Chilika population of the species. Phylogenetic analysis indicated distinct clades within the Asian samples, with the Indian population showing closest genetic proximity to the haplotypes from Thailand. Sex of the animal was determined by PCR-based method. It is important to continue to examine the population discreteness and genetic variation of Irrawaddy dolphin in Chilika Lagoon vis-A -vis its global geographic distribution for formulating the conservation plans of the species.

TI AN OCCURRENCE OF THE PROTOCETID WHALE "EOCETUS" WARDII IN THE MIDDLE
   EOCENE PINEY POINT FORMATION OF VIRGINIA
SO JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY
AB Two protocetid whale vertebrae, here referred to "Eocetus" wardii, have been recovered from the riverbed of the Pamunkey River in east-central Virginia. Neither bone was found in situ, but both were found with lumps of lithified matrix cemented to their surfaces. Most of this matrix was removed and processed for microfossils. Specimens of dinoflagellates were successfully recovered and this flora clearly demonstrates that both vertebrae came from the middle Eocene Piney Point Formation, which crops out above and below river level in the area where the bones were discovered. These vertebrae are the oldest whale remains reported from Virginia and are as old as any cetacean remains known from the western hemisphere.

TI DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL CETACEANS IN THE NEARSHORE WATERS OF SARAWAK, EAST
   MALAYSIA
SO RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY
AB Between June 2008 and September 2009, 56 days of small boat surveys were conducted off the coast of Sarawak, Malaysia with the aim of recording cetacean distribution. These surveys, which focused on the Miri, Bintulu-Similajau and Kuching regions, comprised 173 hours of survey effort and covered 2851 km of pre-determined systematic tracks. Surveys were clustered into three sets of seasonal snapshots: June-July, September-October and March-April. A total of 115 cetacean sightings were made, of which 65 were on-effort and used in analyses of cetacean encounter rates in relation to habitat characteristics. Species observed included (in order of frequency) Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris), finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis).
   One hundred and ten of 115 sightings were made in less than 10 m water depth, highlighting the importance of nearshore coastal habitats for these species. Despite an apparent overlap in habitat, Irrawaddy dolphins showed a statistically significant affiliation with areas of shallower depth and closer proximity to shore and river mouths than finless porpoises or bottlenose dolphins. This preference for nearshore areas renders the species vulnerable to threats such as fisheries by-catch and habitat degradation from coastal development. Irrawaddy dolphins were more frequently encountered in Kuching, while the highest encounter rate for finless porpoises was in the Bintulu-Similajau region. Depictions of encounter rates in these regions in relation to survey effort in 2 km x 2 km grid-cells give an indication of the preferred habitats of Irrawaddy dolphins, and show that the highest encounter rates in both Kuching and Similajau occurred in areas that are destined for major coastal developments. The information presented here should help researchers and managers design effective future research and conservation strategies.

TI Abundance of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Cetacea:
   Delphinidae), inhabiting the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil:
   Implications for conservation
SO ZOOLOGIA
AB A new mark-recapture abundance estimate and a photographic census were carried out to investigate the possible decline in the abundance of the bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), in the Patos Lagoon estuary due to the high levels of bycatch mortality which occurred between 2002 and 2006 in oceanic coastal areas close to the estuary. Fourteen systematic boat surveys were conducted between August and early December 2005 to photo-identify the bottlenose dolphins. The estimated number of animals, with long-lasting marks, in the population obtained from Chapman's and M-th models were 51(95% CI = 49-53) and 52 (95% CI = 51-60), respectively. Taking into account the proportion of dolphins with long-lasting marks in the population, the total estimated population size ranged between 84 (95% CI = 76-93) and 86 (95% CI = 78-95) individuals, respectively, which was very similar to the 84 individuals revealed by the population census. Our results did not differ from the abundance estimate carried out in 1998, prior to the high fishing-related mortality event, suggesting that the population is stable. Plausible argument to explain the stability of the population is that some carcasses found on the oceanic coastal beaches near Patos Lagoon estuary come from animals that do not belong to the estuary community. Future studies should investigate fine-scale habitat partition between estuarine and adjacent coastal dolphins. If the existence of different communities living in close proximity (estuarine and coastal areas near to the estuary) is confirmed, a new abundance estimate is needed to access the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in this region.

TI Recurring patterns in the songs of humpback whales (Megaptera
   novaeangliae)
SO BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
AB Humpback whales, unlike most mammalian species, learn new songs as adults. Populations of singers progressively and collectively change the sounds and patterns within their songs throughout their lives and across generations. In this study, humpback whale songs recorded in Hawaii from 1985 to 1995 were analyzed using self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify the sounds within songs, and to identify sound patterns that were present across multiple years. These analyses supported the hypothesis that recurring, persistent patterns exist within whale songs, and that these patterns are defined at least in part by acoustic relationships between adjacent sounds within songs. Sound classification based on acoustic differences between adjacent sounds yielded patterns within songs that were more consistent from year to year than classifications based on the properties of single sounds. Maintenance of fixed ratios of acoustic modulation across sounds, despite large variations in individual sounds, suggests intrinsic constraints on how sounds change within songs. Such acoustically invariant cues may enable whales to recognize and assess variations in songs despite propagation-related distortion of individual sounds and yearly changes in songs.

TI Beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) passive acoustic detection in
   increasing ambient noise
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB Passive acoustic detection is being increasingly used to monitor visually cryptic cetaceans such as Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) that may be especially sensitive to underwater sound. The efficacy of passive acoustic detection is traditionally characterized by the probability of detecting the animal's sound emissions as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. The probability of detection can be predicted using accepted, but not necessarily accurate, models of the underwater acoustic environment. Recent field studies combining far-field hydrophone arrays with on-animal acoustic recording tags have yielded the location and time of each sound emission from tagged animals, enabling in-situ measurements of the probability of detection. However, tagging studies can only take place in calm seas and so do not reflect the full range of ambient noise conditions under which passive acoustic detection may be used. Increased surface-generated noise from wind and wave interaction degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of animal sound receptions at a given distance leading to a reduction in probability of detection. This paper presents a case study simulating the effect of increasing ambient noise on detection of M. densirostris foraging clicks recorded from a tagged whale swimming in the vicinity of a deep-water, bottom-mounted hydrophone array.

TI Occurrence of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata subsp.)
   around the Antarctic Peninsula
SO POLAR BIOLOGY
AB The occurrence of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata subsp.) around the Antarctic Peninsula was examined based on 406 sightings of minke whales recorded during the Chilean Antarctic Scientific Expeditions and other opportunistic cetacean surveys. Identification of the species was made only for the whales sighted in the proximity of the vessels when the specific diagnostic characters could be confirmed. Of the 406 sightings, 296 were assigned to Antarctic (519 individuals), nine (11 individuals) to dwarf and 101 to unidentified minke whales (149 individuals). Dwarf minke whales were identified by the reported external diagnostic characters for this species. Seven animals occurred around the South Shetland Island and four in the Gerlache Strait. In addition, another two animals were identified as dwarf minke whales in the Bellinghausen Sea in winter 1993, being these the most southern records for this species. These results confirm the occurrence of dwarf minke whales around the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer seasons, as well as in the Bellinghausen Sea in winter. The geographical range of these sightings was comprised between 61 degrees 03' and 69 degrees 25'S and between 55 degrees 29' and 86 degrees 53'W. These results also suggest that some dwarf minke whales remain in the Antarctic during the austral winter.

TI Relaxin and progesterone during pregnancy and the post-partum period in
   association with live and stillborn calves in bottlenose dolphins
   (Tursiops truncatus)
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The objectives of this study were to validate a relaxin and progesterone RIA for use in bottlenose dolphins, and quantify and characterize both hormones in extracts of placental tissue and serum collected during pregnancy and the post-partum period, and compare the results between dolphins with live and stillborn calves. In Experiment 1, validation of a heterologous relaxin and progesterone RIA involved specific displacement of antibody-bound radiolabeled human relaxin or progesterone in response to increasing volumes of pooled pregnant dolphin serum and amounts of respective hormone standards added to a fixed volume of serum. The displacement curves were considered parallel and additive relative to respective standard curves. In Experiment 2, immunoreactive relaxin and progesterone were detected in placental extracts and, in corresponding serum samples, concentrations of both hormones were higher during the pre-partum than post-partum periods. Circulatory concentrations of progesterone decreased (P < 0.05) from relatively high concentrations during early and mid-pregnancy to intermediate concentrations by late pregnancy (month effect, P < 0.0001) in dolphins with live births, whereas, in dolphins with stillbirths, the decrease in progesterone began earlier (month-by-birth status interaction, P < 0.007); mean concentrations were lower at mid- (37%, P < 0.06) and late (25%) pregnancy. Temporally, relaxin increased (P < 0.05) progressively from relatively low concentrations during early pregnancy to high concentrations during late pregnancy (month effect, P < 0.0001) and was not different between birth statuses (birth status effect. P = 0.76; month-by-birth status interaction, P = 0.17). Even though the interaction did not reach significance, mean relaxin concentrations were 42%, 29%, and 34% lower at early, mid-, and late pregnancy, respectively, in dolphins with stillbirths than in those with live births. In conclusion, the pregnancy-specific increase in serum concentrations of relaxin and lower concentrations of both relaxin and progesterone in association with stillbirths suggest the potential for relaxin to be used diagnostically to determine pregnancy status, and one or both hormones to be used to assess placental function, and, perhaps, fetal well-being in bottlenose dolphins and other cetaceans.

In the present study, 178 tissue samples from 76 stranded cetacean individuals were tested for the presence of herpesviruses. Herpesvirus genomic DNA fragments surrounding the DNA polymerase gene were amplified in samples from four individuals. TA cloning and direct sequencing of these DNA fragments revealed the presence of two novel alphaherpesviruses, and two novel gammaherpesviruses in the four cetacean individuals. The alphaherpesviruses were associated with the lung tissue of a false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and with the mucus of a melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra). The gammaherpesviruses were found in the lymph tissues of a Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). The phylogenetic tree using amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase gene supported the inclusion of the novel viruses identified here in a single monophyletic group containing alphaherpesviruses from other Atlantic cetacean species. Conversely, the novel gammaherpesviruses formed an independent clade distant from other known cetacean gammaherpesviruses.

TI True Hermaphroditism: First Evidence of an Ovotestis in a Cetacean
   Species
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY
AB An immature unilateral hermaphrodite common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) was found stranded on the southwest coast of the UK. The external phenotype was that of a female, but internally there was one ovotestis, containing both ovarian follicles and testicular tubular elements, and a contralateral ovary. Ovarian portions of the ovotestis appeared normal and demonstrated follicular development, whereas the testicular tissue exhibited hypoplasia and degeneration. This is the first reported case of an ovotestis in a cetacean species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Stable isotopes of captive cetaceans (killer whales and bottlenose
   dolphins)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB There is currently a great deal of interest in using stable isotope methods to investigate diet, trophic level and migration in wild cetaceans. In order to correctly interpret the results stemming from these methods, it is crucial to understand how diet isotopic values are reflected in consumer tissues. In this study, we investigated patterns of isotopic discrimination between diet and blood constituents of two species of cetaceans (killer whale, Orcinus orca, and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus) fed controlled diets over 308 and 312 days, respectively. Diet discrimination factors (Delta; mean +/- s.d.) for plasma were estimated to Delta(13)C=2.3 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand and Delta(15)N=1.8 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand, respectively, for both species and to Delta(13)C=2.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand and Delta(15)N=0.5 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for red blood cells. Delipidation did not have a significant effect on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of blood constituents, confirming that cetacean blood does not serve as a reservoir of lipids. In contrast, carbon isotopic values were higher in delipidated samples of blubber, liver and muscle from killer whales. The potential for conflict between fisheries and cetaceans has heightened the need for trophic information about these taxa. These results provide the first published stable isotope incorporation data for cetaceans, which are essential if conclusions are to be drawn on issues concerning trophic structures, carbon sources and diet reconstruction.

TI Genetic differentiation among North Atlantic killer whale populations
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Population genetic structure of North Atlantic killer whale samples was resolved from differences in allele frequencies of 17 microsatellite loci, mtDNA control region haplotype frequencies and for a subset of samples, using complete mitogenome sequences. Three significantly differentiated populations were identified. Differentiation based on microsatellite allele frequencies was greater between the two allopatric populations than between the two pairs of partially sympatric populations. Spatial clustering of individuals within each of these populations overlaps with the distribution of particular prey resources: herring, mackerel and tuna, which each population has been seen predating. Phylogenetic analyses using complete mitogenomes suggested two populations could have resulted from single founding events and subsequent matrilineal expansion. The third population, which was sampled at lower latitudes and lower density, consisted of maternal lineages from three highly divergent clades. Pairwise population differentiation was greater for estimates based on mtDNA control region haplotype frequencies than for estimates based on microsatellite allele frequencies, and there were no mitogenome haplotypes shared among populations. This suggests low or no female migration and that gene flow was primarily male mediated when populations spatially and temporally overlap. These results demonstrate that genetic differentiation can arise through resource specialization in the absence of physical barriers to gene flow.

TI Lobomycosis-like disease in wild bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus
   of Laguna, southern Brazil: monitoring of a progressive case
SO DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB Lobomycosis is a chronic dermal infection affecting humans and small cetaceans. In 1993, a study identified the presence of the etiologic agent of lobomycosis in a resident population of Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphin) in Laguna, Brazil. Until now, no additional information relating to the persistence or prevalence of this pathogen in this population has been available. Numbering less than 60 animals, the residency of these dolphins in an impacted lagoon system has raised concerns about the health and viability of this small population. Using photo-identification data collected between September 2007 and September 2009, this study evaluated the occurrence of lobomycosis-like disease (LLD) throughout this population. Of 47 adult dolphins and 10 calves identified, 7 (12%) presented some form of epidermal lesion and 5 (9%) had evidence of LLD. The lesions were stable in all but 2 cases, in which a progressive development was recorded in a presumed adult female and her calf (referred to here as the LLD pair). During the first few months of observation, the lesion grew slowly and at a constant rate on the adult. However, in the fourteenth month, the growth rate increased rapidly and the first lesions appeared on the calf. Compared to the rest of the population, the LLD pair also presented a different spatial ranging pattern, suggesting a possible social or geographic factor. Current and previous records of LLD or lobomycosis indicate that the disease is endemic in this population. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring both the health of these cetaceans and the quality of their habitat.

TI Molecular taxonomy of marine mammals stranded along Kerala coast, India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Application of molecular tools for the identification of threatened marine mammals has gained importance in recent years. Though live and dead strandings of cetaceans are common along the Indian coasts, the specimens are often not properly identified due to the lack of local taxonomic expertise and poor quality of the specimens. Two marine mammals washed ashore in a putrefied condition at Edayar (08 degrees 25'N lat., 76 degrees 57'E long.), Thiruvananthapuram District, southwest coast of India, were identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and COI genes. Sequence and phylogenetic similarity search done with all entries in the DNA sequence database, GenBank using BLAST identified the stranded mammals as Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) and finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides). The present report is the second record of B. edeni from the southwest coast of India.

TI Bones as biofuel: a review of whale bone composition with implications
   for deep-sea biology and palaeoanthropology
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Whales are unique among vertebrates because of the enormous oil reserves held in their soft tissue and bone. These 'biofuel' stores have been used by humans from prehistoric times to more recent industrial-scale whaling. Deep-sea biologists have now discovered that the oily bones of dead whales on the seabed are also used by specialist and generalist scavenging communities, including many unique organisms recently described as new to science. In the context of both cetacean and deep-sea invertebrate biology, we review scientific knowledge on the oil content of bone from several of the great whale species: Balaenoptera musculus, Balaenoptera physalus, Balaenoptera borealis, Megaptera novaeangliae, Eschrichtius robustus, Physeter macrocephalus and the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba. We show that data collected by scientists over 50 years ago during the heyday of industrial whaling explain several interesting phenomena with regard to the decay of whale remains. Variations in the lipid content of bones from different parts of a whale correspond closely with recently observed differences in the taphonomy of deep-sea whale carcasses and observed biases in the frequency of whale bones at archaeological sites.

AB This paper presents a framework effort to allow the experimentation of various devices in order to automatically record, detect and classify marine mammal vocalizations in the open sea. Some tools for the protection of Killer Whales and other cetaceans are founded in the analysis of their recorded vocalizations. With this framework we are able to test every part under controlled conditions before open sea experiments. Some of these devices have been designed to localize and track open sea populations in order to facilitate data collection for conservation management.
   At this moment the framework consists of the basic necessary instruments and IT resources for continuously multichannel recording of vocalizations from four specimens of Killer Whale. The enormous raw data stream forces the implementation of a data reduction strategy. As a result, the present research is focused in the development of techniques for this purpose that will allow the automatic classification of events and obtain statistical data. Complementarily, our research goals are also focused on the design of prototypes for source localization using time tags of events on multiple channels for continuous real time logging of behaviour and position of specimens. This paper presents some preliminary results of automatically detected calls.

AB Whales living within seismically active regions are subject to intense disturbances from strong sounds produced by earthquakes that can kill or injure individuals. Nishimura & Clark (1993) relate the possible effects of underwater earthquake noise levels in marine mammals, adducing that T-phase source signal level (10- to 30- Hz range) can exceed 200 dB re: 1 mu Pa at 1 m, for a magnitude 4-5 earthquake, sounds audible to fin whales which produce low frequency sounds of 16-20/25-44 Hz over 0.5-1s, typically of 183 dB re: 1 mu Pa at 1 m. Here we present the response of a fin whale to a 5.5 Richter scale earthquake that took place on 22 February 2005, in the Gulf of California. The whale covered 13 km in 26 min (mean speed = 30.2 km/h). We deduce that the sound heard by this whale might have triggered the costly energy expenditure of high speed swimming as a seismic-escape response. These observations support the hypothesis of Richardson et al. (1995) that cetaceans may flee from loud sounds before they are injured, when exposed to noise in excess of 140 dB re: 1 mu Pa 1 m.

TI Reports of Humpback and Minke Whales in the Hudson Bay Region, Eastern
   Canadian Arctic
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
AB We summarize recently reported sightings of Megaptera novaeangliae (Humpback Whales) and Balaenoptera acuturostrata (Minke Whales) in the Hudson Bay region, in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Balaena mystic:ems (Bowhead Whale) is the only baleen whale historically known from Hudson Bay, and during the commercial whaling era (1860-1915), no other large whale was reported to occur there. We note recent (ca. last 10 years) Humpback observations reported by local Inuit hunters in Hudson Bay and northern Foxe Basin. One Humpback was also observed by cetacean biologists in Ungava Bay during an aerial survey for Delphinapterus leucas (Beluga Whales). Minke Whales have previously been reported in southern Hudson Bay and James Bay, and recent discussions with Inuit hunters have indicated possible sightings in Foxe Basin and western Hudson Bay. They are commonly observed by Inuit in eastern Hudson Strait, where there have also been recent detections by biologists. Observations of these species in Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin may be related to reduced ice cover and increased open water, changes in prey species distributions, population recovery and growth following commercial whaling, or some combination of factors. More efficient reporting of observations is needed, and improved community-level monitoring would assist with documentation of temperate-region species in high-latitude areas.

TI SOCIAL AGGREGATION IN THE PELAGIC ZONE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO FISH
   AND INVERTEBRATES
SO ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 60
SE Advances in Marine Biology
AB Aggregations of organisms, ranging from zooplankton to whales, are an extremely common phenomenon in the pelagic zone; perhaps the best known are fish schools. Social aggregation is a special category that refers to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult, especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization, miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data, and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling species, these changes could have important consequences for the dependent businesses.

TI Small size in the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus in the
   eastern Mediterranean: a possible case of Levantine nanism
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB The phenomenon of Levantine nanism in the Mediterranean Sea has so far been described in invertebrates and fish. We explored the possibility that it would also apply to marine mammals. To that end, we compared total body length (TBL) and skull condylobasal length (CBL) of adult common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus collected along the Israeli coastline (representing the Levantine subpopulation) to those of specimens collected along the shores of western Mediterranean seas. Significant differences were found between mean (+/- SD) CBL values of 40 skulls from Israel and a pooled sample of 40 skulls from the Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, Ligurian and Balearic Seas (49.70 +/- 1.87 and 52.18 +/- 1.47 cm, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) TBL of 26 Israeli animals were significantly smaller than those of 28 animals from the Spanish Mediterranean coast and 36 animals from the French Mediterranean coast (272 +/- 18.0, 317.3 +/- 16.1 and 313.4 +/- 14.8 cm, respectively, p < 0.001). The results clearly demonstrate that animals of the Levantine subpopulation are significantly smaller than those residing in the west. A difference of similar to 16% for TBL between populations fits the range of within-species dwarf morphs in cetaceans and, when translated into volume and mass, also fits the definition of Levantine nanism.

TI Modelling sperm whale habitat preference: a novel approach combining
   transect and follow data
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus habitat preferences are still poorly understood in the Mediterranean, despite the population being classified as 'Endangered' by the IUCN. Techniques to make the best use of multiple data sources are important in improving this situation. This work provides a detailed evaluation of sperm whale distribution and habitat use around the Balearic Islands using a novel analytical framework that combines transect and follow data while accounting for any autocorrelation present. During dedicated research cruises (2003 to 2008), sperm whales were located by listening at regular intervals along a search track and subsequently followed acoustically. Sperm whales were encountered 56 times and followed for periods ranging from a few hours to 3 d. Logistic Generalized Additive Models were used to model the probability of whale presence across the study area as a function of environmental variables, and Generalized Estimating Equations were used to account for autocorrelation. The results suggest that sperm whales do not use the region uniformly and that topography plays a key role in shaping their distribution. Moreover, solitary individuals were found to use the habitat differently from groups. This segregation appeared to be driven by water temperature and might reflect different needs or intraspecific competition. By shedding light on sperm whale habitat preference in such a critical area, this study represents an important step towards the implementation of conservation measures for this population.

TI Community structure in pelagic marine mammals at large spatial scales
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB The understanding of a species' niche is fundamental to the concept of ecology, yet relatively little work has been done on niches in pelagic marine mammal communities. Data collection on the distribution and abundance of marine mammals is costly, time consuming and complicated by logistical difficulties. Here we take advantage of a data archive comprising many different datasets on the distribution and abundance of cetaceans from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico in an effort to uncover community structure at large spatial scales (1000s of km). We constructed a multivariate ordination of the species data, tested for group structure that might exist within the ordination space, and determined how these groups might differ in environmental space. We examined 3 biogeographic regions: the oceanic waters north and south of Cape Hatteras, NC, and the Gulf of Mexico. North of Hatteras, we found 2 main groups split along a temperature and chlorophyll gradient, with most piscivores being found in cooler, more productive waters of the continental shelf, and most teuthivores being found farther offshore in warmer, less productive waters at the shelf break (200 m isobath). South of Hatteras, we found 3 groups, with the largest group being in warmer, lower chlorophyll waters that are closest to shore. In the Gulf of Mexico, we found 7 groups arrayed along a bottom depth gradient. We also tested the effect of taxonomically lumping different beaked whale species on ordination results. Results showed that when beaked whales were identified to the species level, they clustered out into distinct niches that are separate from those of other Odontocete groups. These results add to an increasing understanding of wildlife habitat associations and niche partitionings in the community structure of pelagic species, and provide important baseline information for future population monitoring efforts.

AB Strandings of cetaceans and sea turtles in the Alboran Sea and Strait of Gibraltar: a long-term glimpse at the north coast (Spain) and the south coast (Morocco).-A total of 13 species of cetaceans and three species of marine turtles were found in this study. Data were collected by eight independent and self-regulated stranding networks, providing information about 1,198 marine mammal (10 odontocetii, three mysticetii and one phocidae) and 574 sea turtle stranding events between 1991 and 2008. Trends in the strandings were analysed in relation to species composition and abundance, and their geographic and seasonal distribution. The most abundant species recorded were the striped dolphin and the loggerhead turtle. Some of the strandings, such as the humpback whale, harbour porpoise, hooded seal and olive ridley turtle, were considered 'rare' because their distribution did not match the pattern of the study. When the north and south coasts in the study area were compared, pilot whales stranded more frequently in the north, while delphinid species stranded more in the south coast, and loggerhead turtles stranded more frequently in the north while leatherback turtles stranded more in south coast.

TI Far from home: Record of a vagrant striped dolphin in Patagonia with
   notes on diet, parasites and age determination
SO MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB The striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba (Meyen, 1833), is a pelagic small cetacean with primary distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Here, we present a record of a vagrant individual of striped dolphin in Patagonia, out of its distribution range. The animal was 1 year old, measured 148 cm. and weighted 35 Kg. The specimen was classified as immature due to the small development of the epididym and the absence of spermatozoa in testicular smear. Helminths found belong to two families of Cestoda: cysts of Phyllobothrium delphini (Phyllobothriidae) and Tetrabothrius sp. (Tetrabothriidae). In addition, 1 Pholeter gastrophilus (Digenea: Pholeteridae) was collected. In the stomach we found two cephalopod beaks, identified as argentine shortfin squid and lesser shining bobtail and 6 crystallines of non-identified small fishes. This stranding event constitutes the most southern record for the species at the Argentine coast and highlights the importance of systematically recording strandings as an integral part of any program aimed at monitoring the well-being of local cetacean communities.

TI Encounters with pelagic and continental slope cetacean species near the
   northern shore of the Gulf of Taranto, Italy
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB Little is known about the distribution and species composition of cetaceans in the Gulf of Taranto, central Mediterranean Sea. Available information is limited to stranding reports and to scant preliminary observations at sea. Cetacean sightings were recorded between April 2007 and October 2009 during 23 daily boat surveys, totalling 1728 km of navigation. Three cetacean species were encountered: striped dolphins (n = 41), Risso's dolphins (n = 5) and fin whales (n = 3). An additional sighting of a sperm whale group is reported. Encounter rates of striped dolphins were the highest, suggesting a regular occurrence in the study area. Risso's dolphins seemed to be predictably present in continental slope waters off the coast of Basilicata. Fin whales and striped dolphins, normally inhabiting deep pelagic waters offshore, were found in continental slope waters relatively close to the coast, possibly due to the particular bathymetry of the Gulf of Taranto and to oceanographic conditions that enhance local productivity. High human impact and worsening environmental conditions in the northern Gulf of Taranto raise concerns over the future of cetaceans living in these waters. This study expands previous knowledge and aims to stimulate research on whales and dolphins in what seems to be an important portion of their Mediterranean range.

TI Is it possible to go whale watching off the coast of Peru? A case study
   of humpback whales
SO LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH
AB Whale watching is the human activity of encountering cetaceans in their natural habitat for recreational and scientific purposes. Despite the high diversity of cetaceans in Peruvian waters, this activity has yet to be developed. Herein we present data regarding the distribution of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off northern Peru, evaluating the possibility of extending whale watching activities in this area. Data were obtained from surveys conducted from an ecotourism boat. Humpbacks were distributed in shallow waters, usually in pairs or trios throughout the study period between late July and late September. The presence of whales off northern Peru is due to winter migration for breeding and calving purposes. A high probability of encountering humpbacks within the study area could encourage the development of a whale watching industry. As this stage in the life cycle of this species is very delicate, we suggest the adoption of the precautionary principle in the management of the activity in order to minimize the risk of negative impacts on humpback populations. Whale watching in northern Peru is feasible and could be considered an alternative to fishing.

TI Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphin habitat modeling from passive
   acoustic monitoring
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Habitat characterization allows prediction of dolphin distributions in response to oceanographic processes and can be used to understand and predict effects of anthropogenic disturbances. Many habitat models focus on contemporary dolphin occurrence and environmental predictor data, but time-lagged oceanographic data may increase a model's predictive power due to ecological successional processes. Using hourly occurrence of Risso's dolphin Grampus griseus clicks and 2 types of Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens clicks in autonomous passive acoustic recordings, we investigate the importance of time-lagged predictor variables with generalized additive models. These models relate dolphin acoustic activity from recordings at 6 sites in the Southern California Bight between August 2005 and December 2007 to oceanographic variables including sea surface temperature (SST), SST coefficient of variation (CV), sea surface chlorophyll concentration (chl), chl CV, upwelling indices, and solar and lunar temporal indices. The most consistently selected variables among the trial models evaluated during cross-validation were SST (100% of models) and SST CV (80%) for Risso's dolphin clicks; solar indices (100%) and SST and SST CV (60% each) for Pacific white-sided type A (PWS A) clicks; and SST CV (100%), solar indices (100%) and SST (80%) for Pacific white-sided type B (PWS B) clicks. Best predictive models for Risso's dolphins and PWS A clicks included time-lagged variables, suggesting the importance of ecological succession between abiotic variables and dolphin occurrence, while best models of PWS B clicks were for current conditions, suggesting association with prey-aggregating features such as fronts and eddies.

TI Do Alternative Leaders Affect Fish Catch in Pound Nets at the Mouth of
   Chesapeake Bay?
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
AB More than 60 stranded bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus exhibiting marks consistent with interactions with pound nets have been documented in the lower Chesapeake Bay since 1997. Given this high rate of bycatch, action is needed to mitigate bottlenose dolphin mortality. However, for any such modification to the pound net to be acceptable to fishers, a clear demonstration of no reduction in the targeted finfish catch will be required. Working with fishers, we evaluated the effect of an experimental pound net leader on finfish catch. The experimental leader entailed similar or greater catches of finfish than did the traditional leader. Further, catches of Batoidea (cownose ray Rhinoptera bonasus, bullnose ray Myliobatis freminvillei, southern stingray Dasyatis americana and Atlantic stingray D. sabina) and clearnose skates Raja eglanteria were reduced with the experimental leader. This example demonstrates that working with fishers to devise alternative harvest strategies can result in the implementation of conservation measures. Although finfish catch was maintained with the experimental leader design, we must continue to monitor bottlenose dolphin bycatch to confirm that the use of the experimental leader reduces the bottlenose dolphin mortality associated with pound nets.

TI MAMMALIAN BITE MARKS ON JUVENILE FUR SEAL BONES FROM THE LATE NEOGENE
   PURISIMA FORMATION OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
SO PALAIOS
AB Fossils of extinct fur seals and walruses (Carnivora: Pinnipedia) occur within rich vertebrate fossil assemblages recovered from the shallow marine Mio-Pliocene Purisima Formation, central California. Two isolated postcranial bones-a humerus and a radius-belonging to a juvenile fur seal (Pinnipedia: Otariidae) exhibit circular depressions. These bone modifications are associated with radial and circular fractures, and are characterized by inward displacement of the cortex. These depressions lack features typical of erosive invertebrate borings, trampling damage from media (=substrate) interaction, puncturing by another object during diagenetic compaction, such as a clast embedded or associated with the modification, or pathologic bone modification. These features are best interpreted as tooth marks. These tooth marks lack certain characteristics of commonly reported marks inflicted by shark teeth, such as linear gouges and subparallel scrapes formed by xiphodont and serrated teeth. These bone modifications instead exhibit a circular shape and inward displacement of the cortex, consistent with puncturing by a conical mammal tooth. The size and distribution of the tooth marks, in concert with the known vertebrate assemblage from the Purisima Formation, indicate several possible producers of the bone modifications: a pilot whale or beluga-like cetacean, a terrestrial carnivore, a dusignathine or odobenine walrus, or a case of infanticide by a conspecific otariid.

TI Marine mammal and seabird summer distribution and abundance in the
   fjords of northeast Cumberland Sound of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada
SO POLAR BIOLOGY
AB Critical baseline population knowledge is required to properly assess the status of marine mammal and bird populations in the Canadian Arctic and the effects of climate trends on them. To address this need for one significant Arctic region, a boat-based marine mammal and seabird transect survey was conducted in Cumberland Sound fjords during summer 2008. During 173 km effort (20 h), 959 birds were recorded representing at least nine species which were dominated by Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), Iceland or Glaucous Gulls (Larus glaucoides or Larus hyperboreus), and Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle), in addition to less common birds including Red-throated and Common Loons (Gavia stellata and Gavia immer), Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), and Great or Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus or Larus fuscus). Of these, 480 birds were observed on the water in one event consisting of eiders and gulls which may have biased encounter rates. Of 101 marine mammal sightings, four species were represented: 73 harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus), 13 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), nine bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), five ringed seals (Pusa hispida), and one unidentified pinniped. A pod of four killer whales (Orcinus orca) was observed off-effort in Pangnirtung Fjord during the survey period. This pilot study provided the first estimates of relative abundance for marine mammals and seabirds in the study area to aid in developing future surveys.

TI Distribution and seasonality of cetaceans in tropical waters between
   Angola and the Gulf of Guinea
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB The species richness, spatial distribution, seasonality and interspecific associations of cetaceans in tropical oceanic waters between the Gulf of Guinea and Angola were examined using 5 905.3 h of dedicated survey effort collected from 13 platforms of opportunity (geophysical vessels) between 2004 and 2009, and from incidental records. Most effort (87.8%) was recorded in waters >1 000 m deep. A total of 1 814 on-effort and 1 496 incidental sightings were recorded, comprising 22 species. Physeter macrocephalus and Megaptera novaeangliae were the most frequently sighted cetacean species, with Globicephala macrorhynchus and Stenella frontalis the most frequently sighted delphinids. Five species occurred in both neritic and oceanic waters, while the remainder had exclusively oceanic distributions. The occurrence of P. macrocephalus and M. novaeangliae differed significantly according to depth category. Most species occurred year-round; however, M. novaeangliae exhibited a strong, significant winter and spring occurrence. There were 65 interspecific groups recorded, involving at least 12 species. Mixed schools of G. macrorhynchus and Tursiops truncatus accounted for 55.4% of recorded associations. This extensive year-round dataset adds considerably to the understanding of cetacean distribution in the eastern tropical Atlantic and provides baseline information on which to base cetacean conservation and management in this poorly studied region.

TI Cetacean research in the southern African subregion: a review of
   previous studies and current knowledge
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Cetacean research, in terms of the number of papers, and areas for which data are available, has expanded considerably in the southern African subregion in the past decade, especially in the South-West Indian Ocean. We review cetacean research within this subregion from the 1800s to the present to provide an overview of findings, investigate trends and identify knowledge gaps. Data are presented separately for large whales (those subject to commercial whaling) and smaller cetaceans, and are separated by era and ocean basin. Over 550 peer-reviewed papers and books were identified relating to research on cetaceans within the subregion. More than half (284) have been produced since 1990 and 193 relate specifically to South African waters. The most-studied species are those that are most accessible due to their coastal distributions (southern right whale Eubalaena australis: 45 papers, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae: 31 papers, killer whales Orcinus orca: 27 papers, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus: 30 papers, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin Sousa chinensis (plumbea form): 25 papers) and/or were hunted commercially (sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus: 25 papers). Identified conservation concerns vary throughout the subregion, but include bycatch and directed hunts, oil and gas development, ecotourism activities, shifts in prey resources, and noise and chemical pollution. The inshore stocks of Bryde's whales Balaenoptera edeni, the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the Atlantic humpback dolphin S. teuszii were identified as the populations of highest conservation concern, although there are considerable knowledge gaps relating to deep-water species and almost no data (even on species occurrence) are available for several areas and countries.

TI A review of interactions between cetaceans and fisheries in the Azores
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Interactions between cetaceans and fishing activity in the Archipelago of the Azores were examined using information contained in grey literature and previously unpublished data collected by observer programmes and research projects from 1998 to 2006. Together with a brief description of the economics, gear, fishing effort, and past and ongoing monitoring projects, levels of cetacean bycatch and interference were reported for each major fishery.
   2. Cetaceans were present in 7% (n = 973) and interfered in 3% (n = 452) of the fishing events monitored by observers aboard tuna-fishing vessels. Interference resulted in a significantly higher proportion of events with zero catches but it was also associated with higher tuna catches.
   3. There was a decreasing trend in the proportion of tuna-fishing events with cetacean presence or interference throughout this study, as well as a reduction in the estimates of dolphins captured annually by the whole fleet.
   4. Observers reported cetacean depredation in 16% of the sets for demersal species and in 2% of the sets for swordfish. Cetacean presence and depredation were associated with higher overall catches and higher catches per unit effort in demersal fisheries. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were responsible for most depredation events in demersal fisheries, whereas in the swordfish fishery, depredation was associated with the presence of killer whales (Orcinus orca). There were no reports of cetacean bycatch in these fisheries. There were also no reports of cetaceans interacting in the experimental deep-sea fisheries that were examined.
   5. Available data suggests that levels of interaction between cetaceans and Azorean fisheries are generally low and that the economic impact of cetacean interference is probably small. However, for several traditional fisheries there are no accurate data to determine levels of cetacean interaction. We recommend that existing observer programmes be expanded to increase observer coverage of the demersal and swordfish fisheries and allow monitoring of other existing and emerging fisheries.

TI Cookie Cutter Shark (Isistius sp.) Bites on Cetaceans, with Particular
   Reference to Killer Whales (Orca) (Orcinus orca)
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Forty-nine species of cetaceans have been recorded in the literature with cookie cutter shark (Isistius sp.) bites. The first record of a cookie cutter shark bite mark on orca (Orcinus orca) was from New Zealand waters in 1955. We present 37 unpublished records of cookie cutter shark bite marks on orca in tropical to cold waters; a further six published records were collated, and additionally 35 individuals with bite marks were noted in photo-identification catalogues. A total of 120 individuals and 198 bite marks were recorded, with the northernmost at 70 degrees 44' N and the southernmost at 77 degrees 14' S. We provide the first healing rate of a cookie cutter shark bite mark on an orca in New Zealand waters, with a maximum of 150 d between open wound and healed scar. Longevity of scars is considered, with one particular bite mark still visible as a dark grey oval/elliptic mark 1,158 d post photographing the open wound. Open cookie cutter shark bite marks were not observed on orca photographed in Antarctic waters, despite the majority of bite marks being recorded on Antarctic orca. This suggests a high level of movement outside the Antarctic cold water regions as the known distribution of cookie cutter sharks is in warm temperate to tropical waters. Supporting evidence for these movements is given by records of Antarctic orca in New Zealand waters with open cookie cutter shark bite marks.

TI Using Static Acoustic Monitoring to Describe Echolocation Behaviour of
   Heaviside's Dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) in Namibia
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Static acoustic monitoring is a cost-effective, low-effort means of gathering large datasets on echolocation click characteristics and habitat use by odontocetes. Heaviside's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) were monitored using an acoustic monitoring unit, the T-POD, in July 2008 at a site of known high abundance for this species in Walvis Bay, Namibia. The T-POD successfully detected clicks from Heaviside's dolphins, and these clicks were detected in the 120 to 140 kHz frequency range. A distinct diel pattern to the hourly mean inter-click interval was observed, with higher values during daylight hours than at night, suggesting that click trains are produced at faster rates at night time. There was no apparent diel pattern in the proportion of buzz trains produced, however. A diel pattern in click activity was observed, with many more detection-positive minutes per hour recorded between dusk and dawn, and vocalization activity dropping to low levels in the middle of the day. This corresponded with visual observations made on abundance of dolphins in the study area. These results suggest that Heaviside's dolphins use this site primarily during the night. Static acoustic monitoring proved to be an effective technique for monitoring patterns of habitat use by Heaviside's dolphins.

TI Abundance, Distribution, and Group Composition of Indian River Lagoon
   Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Information on the abundance and distribution of cetaceans is essential to management and conservation and necessary to assess mortality trends and anthropogenic impacts for stock assessment. Line-transect aerial surveys (n = 45) were conducted to assess bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) abundance, distribution, and group composition in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuary system, Florida, from 2002 to 2004. Calves composed 9.41% of all known age class animals sighted. Multiple covariate distance sampling was used to estimate abundance. Abundance estimates varied seasonally, ranging between 362 (95% CI = 192 to 622; summer 2003) and 1,316 dolphins (95% CI = 795 to 2,061; winter 2002-2003), with a mean abundance of 662 dolphins (95% CI = 544 to 842). Abundance estimates for the Mosquito Lagoon sub-basin exhibited the greatest seasonal variability. Seasonal differences in abundance within strata suggest seasonal movement patterns. This study provides the first abundance estimate for IRL dolphins in over 30 y. Further studies that investigate evidence of influx/efflux are needed to better understand the population biology of IRL dolphins.

SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Serummelatonin, cortisol and testosterone concentrations, and rectal temperature from four captive male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) (estimated age: 36 to 39 y) were measured at 3-h intervals over a 24-h period on the winter solstice, spring equinox and summer solstice in order to (1) investigate diurnal variations in melatonin, cortisol and testosterone concentrations, and rectal temperatures and (2) examine the seasonal changes in parameters for discussing mechanisms of adaptation to the external environment in cetaceans. Serum melatonin, cortisol and testosterone concentrations, and rectal temperature values ranged from <1.6 (detection limit of the assay) to 23.3 pg/mL, 0.8 to 14.0 ng/mL, 0.8 to 23.0 ng/mL, and 35.5 to 37.3 degrees C, respectively. Melatonin measurements were not consistent with expected diurnal rhythm patterns-that is, higher values during the dark phase and lower values during the light phase. However, cortisol and testosterone concentrations and rectal temperatures showed significant diurnal rhythms with acrophases occurring at about the same time in all the seasons. The highest amplitude of testosterone diurnal rhythms, which suggests the resumption of testicular endocrine function, was at the spring equinox, and average testosterone concentrations were the highest at the summer solstice. Serum cortisol concentrations and rectal temperatures were highest at the spring equinox (lowest water temperatures of the three seasons), and there were significant negative correlations between water temperatures and cortisol concentrations and rectal temperatures. The results suggest that changes in secretion patterns and levels of hormones, as well as changes in rectal temperature, are influenced by various factors such as environmental change, seasonal breeding, and required metabolic energy in the captive dolphins.

TI Photo-Identification: A Reliable and Noninvasive Tool for Studying Pink
   River Dolphins (Inia geoffrensis)
SO AQUATIC MAMMALS
AB Photo-identification is an important tool for studying cetacean residence patterns, population size, movements, and social structure. This knowledge directs conservation and management. We examined the reliability of photo-identification studies of pink river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) with the hope of encouraging long-term population monitoring programs. From February 2007 to August 2009, 12 surveys were conducted in two locations of the Colombian Amazon and Orinoco river basins. We obtained 795 suitable digital photographs of Inia dolphins. We evaluated the reliability and duration of photo-identification by describing and evaluating the permanence and consistency of eight mark-types. Marks were categorized as reliable (pigmentation patterns on the dorsal ridge, nicks, bends, and wounds) or supplementary based on their prevalence in the population, and gain and loss rates. We created a catalog of well-marked animals, defined as individuals with at least two reliable marks (55% of the images analyzed for this purpose). It contained photographs of the right side of 57 individuals and the left side of 40 individuals. There were 16 individuals with resightings over a 23-mo period. Future field surveys should use digital cameras with long lenses and fast shutter speeds in areas where dolphins are conspicuous when surfacing.

TI Stereology of the Neocortex in Odontocetes: Qualitative, Quantitative,
   and Functional Implications
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION
AB We investigated the quantitative morphology of the neocortex (gray matter) in 2 toothed whale (odontocete) species (harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena; bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus) with stereological methods. The 4 primary projection areas (motor, somatosensory, auditory, and visual fields) are analyzed for their cell densities in layers III and V with standard design-based stereology methods. Along cortical areas M1, S1, A1, and V1 in Tursiops, neuron density is always higher in layer III than in layer V, whereas the data in Phocoena are variable. Moreover, neuron density in layer III is generally around 1.5 times higher in Tursiops than in Phocoena. Maximal density values are seen in layer III of A1 and V1 in Tursiops and the ratio of layer III/layer V density is maximal in A1 of this species. Thus, layer III could have a higher capacity in the bottlenose dolphin with regard to intrinsic connectivity. Extant knowledge on toothed whale neurobiology and behavior suggests that quantitative/stereological differences between the 2 odontocete species regarding the neuron density of standard cortical units may be correlated with specific adaptations to their respective habitats. In contrast to layers V and VI which mainly serve as an executive system, layer III could represent an intermediate level in sensory and premotor processing which works more tangentially in the cortices via horizontal connections with other cortical areas, respectively. The generally higher density of cortical layer III in Tursiops suggests a higher connectivity of this layer in view of the more agile and complicated behavior of these gregarious animals including versatile phonation by complex sound and ultrasound signals.

TI Modeling the Impacts of Cetacean-Focused Tourism in Taiwan: Observations
   from Cetacean Watching Boats: 2002-2005
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Cetacean-focused tourism in Taiwan has grown rapidly since 1997. This development, measured in terms of both number of tour boats and visitors, has resulted in many resource management challenges stemming from the absence of regulation and scientific data. To fill this void in empirical evidence, we used 464 sighting records from 2002 to 2005 to model the impact of cetacean-focused tourism. Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated cetacean avoidance responses to cetacean watching boats were strongly associated with pod size, mother calf pairs, and cetacean-vessel distances. Mother calf pairs abandoned their avoidance tactic by 55% compared to noncalf groups when tour boats approached. Second, the hazard ratio of abundance was 0.996, suggesting that the odds of encountering avoidance responses by the cetaceans decreased by 42% for every 100-member increase in the cetacean pod size. Last, distances maintained by boats from the cetaceans was positively related to avoidance responses (i.e., less avoidance behavior with closer interaction). Based on our findings, we have the following recommendations: (a) limit vessels from approaching mothers with calves, (b) limit vessels from approaching small groups of cetaceans, (c) reduced avoidance behavior to boat traffic may be a red flag for potential long-term disturbance, and (d) apply the "precautionary principle" based on the best scientific information available in cetacean-based tourism in Taiwan. These recommendations will help contribute to the sustainable development of cetacean-focused tourism in Taiwan.

TI Do dolphins rehearse show-stimuli when at rest? Delayed matching of
   auditory memory
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The mechanisms underlying vocal mimicry in animals remain an open question. Delphinidae are able to copy sounds from their environment that are not produced by conspecifics. Usually, these mimicries occur associated with the context in which they were learned. No reports address the question of separation between auditory memory formation and spontaneous vocal copying although the sensory and motor phases of vocal learning are separated in a variety of songbirds. Here we show that captive bottlenose dolphins produce, during their nighttime resting periods, non-dolphin sounds that they heard during performance shows. Generally, in the middle of the night, these animals produced vocal copies of whale sounds that had been broadcast during daily public shows. As their life history was fully known, we know that these captive dolphins had never had the opportunity to hear whale sounds before then. Moreover, recordings made before the whale sounds started being broadcast revealed that they had never emitted such sounds before. This is to our knowledge the first evidence for a separation between formation of auditory memories and the process of learning to produce calls that match these memories in a marine mammal. One hypothesis is that dolphins may rehearse some special events heard during the daytime and that they then express vocally what could be conceived as a more global memory. These results open the way for broader views on how animals might rehearse life events while resting or maybe dreaming.

TI Dolphins as animal models for type 2 diabetes: Sustained, post-prandial
   hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia
SO GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB There is currently no known natural animal model that fully complements type 2 diabetes in humans. Criteria for a true natural animal model include the presence of a fasting hyperglycemia, evidence of insulin resistance, and pathologies matching that reported in humans. To investigate the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) as a comparative model for type 2 diabetes in humans, hourly plasma and urine chemistry changes, including glucose, were analyzed among five healthy, adult dolphins for 24 h following ingestion of 2.5-3.5 kg of mackerel or 2-3 L of 10% dextrose in ionosol. Fasting and 2 h post-prandial insulin levels were also determined among five adult dolphins to assess the presence of hyperinsulinemia. Finally, a case-control study compared insulin and glucagon levels among dolphins with and without iron overload, a condition associated with insulin resistance in humans. Both protein and dextrose meals caused significant increases in plasma glucose during the 0-5 h post-prandial period; dolphins fed dextrose demonstrated a sustained hyperglycemia lasting 5-10 h. Fasting plasma insulin levels among healthy dolphins mimicked those found in humans with some insulin resistance. Dolphins with hemochromatosis had higher post-prandial plasma insulin levels compared to controls. We conclude that bottlenose dolphins can demonstrate metabolic responses consistent with type 2 diabetes, specifically sustained hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Understanding more about how and why dolphins have a diabetes-like metabolism may provide new research avenues for diabetes in humans. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Taphonomy and paleoenvironmental setting of cetacean remains from the
   Middle Miocene of Tarragona (NE Spain)
SO GEOBIOS
AB A new finding of a marine mammal is documented from the middle Miocene of El Camp basin in Tarragona (NE Spain). The incomplete and disarticulated bone remains belong to the skeleton of a juvenile cetacean. These remains appear deposited above a transgression surface and included within a glauconitic calcisiltite layer. This unit constitutes the beginning of a shallowing-upwards sequence and was deposited under low-energy conditions and low sedimentation rates in a middle-outer platform setting. This context was responsible for the long exposure of the remains and, consequently, an extension of the biostratinomic stage. These conditions favored the natural decomposition and disarticulation of the carcass, allowing the action of different types of scavenging organisms. The interpretation of the paleoenvironmental setting is based in the combination of different datasets: taphonomic data of the bone remains, paleoecologic and taphonomic information provided by the fauna associated to the bones, and ichnologic and sedimentologic interpretation of the sediments where the fossils are included. Combination of such different proxies enables a very good characterization of the paleoenvironmental context of the studied fossils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Experimental fishing with an "umbrella-and-stones" system to reduce
   interactions of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and seabirds with
   bottom-set longlines for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides)
   in the Southwest Atlantic
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Depredation, i.e. the damage or removal, of Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) from longlines by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) can cause considerable economic loss for Spanish fishing vessels in the Southwest Atlantic. The fishery also suffers high bycatch rates of seabirds. The main goal of the study was to assess the extent of depredation and seabird bycatch and to test the potential of the so-called "umbrella" system, coupled with attached stones for faster sinking, for minimizing both. Moreover, we investigated the relationships between sightings of sperm whales, depredation, catches, and environmental variables using generalized additive modelling. Data were collected during 297 hauls on a longliner in 2007/2008 in international waters of the Southwest Atlantic. Sperm whales were sighted during 35% of the hauls, always during gear retrieval, and their presence was positively related to fish damage. The overall depredation rate (0.44% of the total catch) was low, but is assumed to be underestimated because sperm whales were suspected of also taking fish without leaving visual evidence. The "umbrella-and-stones" system was highly effective in preventing bycatch and appeared to restrict depredation, but significantly reduced the catches. The results demonstrate that there is still some way to go to solve the problem of depredation.

TI Insights into Genetic Diversity, Parentage, and Group Composition of
   Atlantic White-Sided Dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) off the West of
   Ireland Based on Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genetic Markers
SO JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
AB The analysis of stranding events and the application of molecular markers can be powerful tools to study cryptic biological aspects of delphinid species that occur mainly in open ocean habitat. In the present study, we investigated nuclear and mitochondrial genetic variability of Atlantic white-sided dolphins that stranded from 1990 to 2006 (n = 42) along the west coast of Ireland, using 8 microsatellite loci and 599 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Results from both classes of markers are concordant with the hypothesis of a large random-mating population of white-sided dolphins along the west coast of Ireland. In addition, the analyses of 2 live mass stranding events (19 and 5 individuals, respectively) revealed that dolphins within each group were mainly unrelated to each other, suggesting dispersal of both sexes from the natal group (i.e., no natal phylopatry). Parentage analyses allowed the identification of mother-offspring pairs but ruled out all adult males as possible fathers. In combination with data on age of individuals, these results confirmed previous knowledge on life-history parameters, with sexually mature females ranging between 11 and 15 years of age and an interbirth interval of at least 2 years. The present study provides novel information on population and group composition of Atlantic white-sided dolphins along the west coast of Ireland, where population and social structure of the species are still poorly understood.

TI Classification of echolocation clicks from odontocetes in the Southern
   California Bight
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB This study presents a system for classifying echolocation clicks of six species of odontocetes in the Southern California Bight: Visually confirmed bottlenose dolphins, short-and long-beaked common dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, Risso's dolphins, and presumed Cuvier's beaked whales. Echolocation clicks are represented by cepstral feature vectors that are classified by Gaussian mixture models. A randomized cross-validation experiment is designed to provide conditions similar to those found in a field-deployed system. To prevent matched conditions from inappropriately lowering the error rate, echolocation clicks associated with a single sighting are never split across the training and test data. Sightings are randomly permuted before assignment to folds in the experiment. This allows different combinations of the training and test data to be used while keeping data from each sighting entirely in the training or test set. The system achieves a mean error rate of 22% across 100 randomized three-fold cross-validation experiments. Four of the six species had mean error rates lower than the overall mean, with the presumed Cuvier's beaked whale clicks showing the best performance (<2% error rate). Long-beaked common and bottlenose dolphins proved the most difficult to classify, with mean error rates of 53% and 68%, respectively. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3514383]

TI Risso's dolphin Grampus griseus in the Mediterranean Sea
SO MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB The ecology and status of Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus worldwide are poorly known. In the Mediterranean Sea, modern field studies of cetaceans only began in the late 1980s and this has resulted in rapid advances in knowledge of some species, but not Risso's dolphin. This paper reviews available information on the distribution and ecology of Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean and identifies factors that may negatively affect them in this region. Risso's dolphins occur in continental slope waters throughout the Mediterranean basin and around many of the region's offshore islands and archipelagos. No synoptic estimate of abundance is available for the Mediterranean region, but densities and overall numbers are low in comparison to some other small odontocetes. Diet consists primarily of cephalopods, with a clear preference for mesopelagic squid. The principal known threat to populations in the Mediterranean is entanglement in pelagic drift gillnets. Other potential problems for Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean include noise disturbance and ingestion of plastic debris. Conservation actions to mitigate the risk of entanglement in fishing gear are likely to benefit Risso's dolphins; specifically, the existing driftnet ban in EU waters should be strictly enforced and extended to the high seas and to waters under non-EU State jurisdiction. More and better data are needed on abundance, distribution, movements, population dynamics and trends in Risso's dolphin populations, and better information on threats (e.g. bycatch in fishing gear) is needed to inform conservation efforts.

TI Reducing the environmental impact of shark-control programs: a case
   study from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Large-scale shark-control programs at popular beaches in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, provide protection against shark attack. Although these programs have enhanced bathing safety, reducing the environmental impacts of decades of fishing for large sharks and the associated by-catch remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, there have been several interventions to reduce such impact in the KZN program. The first was the release of all live sharks, including those species known to be responsible for fatal shark attacks. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the winter influx of shoals of sardines, Sardinops sagax, have been increasingly successful. In addition, extensive removal of nets has resulted in a major reduction in effort. Collectively, these initiatives reduced mortalities of sharks by 64%. Baited lines, termed drumlines, were introduced at 18 beaches, where they replaced some of the nets. The former had a far lower by-catch of rays, turtles and cetaceans and significantly lower catches of certain shark species. Replacement of some nets with drumlines is planned for the remaining beaches. Only two attacks, both non-fatal, have occurred at protected beaches in KZN over the past three decades, indicating that the program has maintained its public safety mandate while it has succeeded in reducing its impact on the environment.

TI Macroecology of marine mammal species in the Mexican Pacific Ocean:
   diversity and distribution
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB The Mexican Pacific Ocean, defined as east of 122 degrees W and from 12 to 34 degrees N, encompasses an oceanographic transition zone with dynamic population and community processes. In order to gain insight into possible marine mammal ecological responses to the current rapid environmental changes, we compiled and analyzed data from 11 145 marine mammal sightings made between 1981 and 2008 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur, and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. In 2 x 2 degrees cells, we computed alpha and beta diversities in terms of species richness, commonness as the occurrence of species among years, tropicality as the proportion of tropical species, and degree of threat according to the IUCN Red List. Current marine mammal distributions seem to derive from a postglacial northwards expansion of tropical pelagic species and a retention of upwelling-rich tropical and subtropical habitats nearshore by antitropical species. Analysis of commonness indicates that species distributions and thus biogeographic boundaries are dynamic, since marine mammals transit large distances, especially around southern Baja California. Analysis of beta diversity showed a considerable degree of spatial heterogeneity, but without well-defined regions. The species at risk are concentrated in the northern Gulf of California, but also occur off Pacific Baja California, Jalisco, and Guerrero coasts. The Gulf of California could be considered a refuge of global value for these animals.

In the ocean, feeding assemblages can involve seabirds, fish, cetaceans, pinnipeds and combinations of these groups. Here we examine association patterns between North Atlantic minke whales and seabirds. Based on the unique feeding strategies of different seabird guilds, predictions were made on the relationship between seabirds and whales in joint feeding assemblages (who profits from whom). These predictions were tested by modelling the presence of a whale with seabird aggregations using logistic regressions, involving presence/absence of seabird guilds, group sizes and measures of diversity as explanatory variables. A strong positive relationship was found between the presence of a whale with a seabird aggregation and the presence and group size of auks, the only seabird group able to concentrate fish on their own. No other seabird guild was relevant in predicting the presence of a whale. This suggests that 'beater' or 'pirate' theory best explains the relationship, with minke whales taking advantage of prey concentrations generated by the feeding behaviour of auks, and other bird groups taking advantage of dead, stunned or scattered prey left by the whales.

TI Infant position in mother-calf dolphin pairs: formation locomotion with
   hydrodynamic benefits
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Cetacean mother-calf dyads demonstrate formation locomotion that may provide hydrodynamic and/or social benefits. For example, echelon position (calf in close proximity of its mother's mid-lateral flank) enables calves to increase swim performance at reduced locomotor effort compared to periods of solitary swimming. Yet cetacean mother-calf dyads are also observed in infant position (calf in close proximity underneath its mother's tailstock), thus we wondered if infant positioning also provides hydrodynamic benefits to calves. Social and hydrodynamic benefits of infant position have both been hypothesized previously, but the logistical difficulties of conducting experiments on free-swimming mother-calf dolphin dyads have precluded empirical quantifications of kinematics until now. We demonstrated that 0 to 98 d old calves of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus are afforded locomotor advantages while swimming in infant position with their mothers. Calves in infant position had reduced locomotor effort via a 24% reduction in fluke stroke amplitude compared to periods of solitary swimming. Yet stroke frequency (the other component of locomotor effort) and swim performance (swim speed) were not different between infant position and solitary swimming. Although swimming in infant position provided some hydrodynamic benefits to calves, these benefits paled in comparison to those afforded to calves maintaining echelon position. Given that echelon position provides the best hydrodynamic benefits, we speculate that older, stronger swimming calves are predominately in infant position because by relinquishing some hydrodynamic benefits of echelon position they gain important social benefits of infant position, particularly camouflage from predators, which undoubtedly plays a vital role in calf survival.

TI Modeling habitat use for dusky dolphin and Commerson's dolphin in
   Patagonia
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB Several species of small cetaceans inhabit the coastal area of Patagonia (Argentina), but little is known about their distribution and the degree of overlap between them. The goal of the present study was to build habitat-selection models for small cetaceans in order to assess areas of particular importance for the different species. These models were constructed using physiographic and remotely sensed variables. From 1994 to 2007, 13 aerial surveys were conducted along the Patagonian coast (from Golfo San Mat as: 40 degrees 40'-42 degrees 14' S, 65 degrees 00'-63 degrees 47' W to Bahia de los Nodales: 48 degrees 00' S, 65 degrees 35' W). A grid of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees cells was constructed for the study area. Each cell was characterized by environmental variables and by the encounter rate (ER) for each cetacean species. The ER of each species was investigated in relation to environmental variables using generalized linear models, and model averaging (multimodel inference) was used to obtain a predicted ER for the different species. The correlation between the ER of different species was analyzed by Spearman rank correlation. The environmental variables that were found to be significant predictors of species distribution differed between species. The ERs of dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus and Peale's dolphin L. australis showed a positive relationship. Commerson's dolphin Cephalorhynchus commersonii presented a more coastal distribution than the other species, and individuals were more often found feeding in estuarine zones. Knowledge of the patterns of distribution of small cetaceans along the Patagonian coast provides baseline knowledge of how these species interact with each other and their environment. Such information should be considered when managing potential areas of conflict between coastal small cetaceans and human activities.

TI Evidence of susceptibility to morbillivirus infection in cetaceans from
   the United States
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Cetacean morbilliviruses (CeMV) are viruses that can cause mass mortalities among various odontocete species. In this study levels of "herd" immunity in cetaceans from the U.S. coast are described from the distribution and prevalence of antibodies against morbilliviruses. Neutralizing antibody titers against dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), phocine distemper (PDV), and canine distemper viruses (CDV) were measured. Positive samples had higher titers against the CeMV than against the other morbilliviruses tested, indicating that although PDV or CDV can be used to investigate exposure their use may result in a higher false negative rate. The results suggest that morbillivirus did not persist in coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) after the major outbreaks that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins from Beaufort, North Carolina; St. Joseph Bay, Florida; and Cape May, New Jersey had anti-DMV seroprevalences ranging from between 15% and 33% but those from Charleston, South Carolina and Sarasota Bay, Florida, sampled in recent years were largely negative. These latter groups are therefore now vulnerable to infection and could experience high mortality if exposed to CeMV. Sero-surveys of this kind are therefore vital for assessing the risk of new and recurring viral outbreaks in coastal cetaceans.

TI Recreational fishing depredation and associated behaviors involving
   common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Odontocete depredation involves stealing or damaging bait or prey already captured by fishing gear. The increase in depredation is of concern for small stocks of cetaceans because interactions with fishing gear can lead to serious injury or mortality through entanglement or ingestion. Using long-term data sets available for the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated recreational fishing gear interactions by (1) examining temporal patterns in depredation and associated behaviors from 2000 to 2007; (2) quantifying the behavior of dolphins that depredate or engage in associated behaviors; and (3) identifying factors associated with the rise in depredation locally. The number of incidents of dolphins (primarily adult males) interacting with recreational anglers and boaters increased following 2004. Depredation and associated behaviors increased during red tide lags and tourist seasons during times of prey depletion and heightened angler and boater activity. Dolphins with a history of fishing gear interactions shifted away from natural activity patterns and were more likely to be within 50 m of fishing lines. Recreational fishing gear interactions were attributed to a two percent population decline in Sarasota Bay in 2006 and need to be considered along with other cumulative human impacts in the development of conservation measures for dolphins.

TI Implication of life history strategies for prenatal investment in
   cetaceans
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Prenatal investment directly determines the size at birth and fetus growth rate, which affects neonatal survival and growth and potentially affects maternal fitness. This study explored the associated prenatal life history traits of cetaceans. Using multivariate analysis and ANCOVA, baleen whales and toothed cetaceans had distinct energy patterns, with two exceptions including beaked whales and eusocial cetaceans. Baleen whales are characterized by fast prenatal growth, which suggests high prenatal energetics, and utilize the capital breeder tactic. Toothed cetaceans, except for beaked whales, utilize income breeder energetics, which yields relatively slow prenatal growth. However, eusocial cetaceans have especially slow prenatal growth, suggesting very low prenatal energetic effort with social compensation. Although beaked whales are behaviorally income breeders, both discriminant analysis and ANCOVA showed that they are energetically similar to baleen whales, utilizing capital energetics. ANCOVA further revealed that beaked whales have comparatively large calf size, suggesting high prenatal investment. Because all cetaceans wean their calves at comparable size, high prenatal investment may further suggest reduced cost of lactation, which may be behaviorally and energetically adaptive to their specific deep-dive-feeding niche.

TI Prenatal data impacts common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)
   growth parameters estimated by length-at-age curves
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Compilation of marine mammal demographic data is central to management efforts. However, marine mammal length-at-age growth curves demonstrate limitations. Physiological growth parameters of terrestrial mammals are typically estimated using curvilinear models fit to size-at-age data along a time series from conception to senescence. The difficulty of collecting and aging prenatal cetaceans is addressed here, and growth parameters of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along coastal Texas were estimated using length-at-age information from a broader scope of age classes, including late-term fetuses. A Gompertz growth curve fit to pre- and postnatal data underestimated size parameters, but demonstrated similar growth rate constants (k) to an exclusively postnatal model. However, when growth parameters were broken out, the absolute growth rate (G) and rate of growth decay (g) decreased (0.44 from 0.27 and 0.55 from 0.39, respectively), which underscores the importance of reporting k in its expanded form (G/g). Although the Gompertz fits most age classes well, it cannot explain growth in all age classes. We argue that a novel sigmoidal model would be more useful for inference.

TI Long-term survival of humpback whales radio-tagged in Alaska from 1976
   through 1978
SO MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE
AB P>Invasive tags designed to provide information on animal movements through radio or satellite monitoring have tremendous potential for the study of whales and other cetaceans. However, to date there have been no published studies on the survival of tagged animals over periods of years or decades. Researchers from the National Marine Mammal Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution tracked five humpback whales with implanted radio tags in southeastern Alaska in August 1976 and July 1977, and tracked two humpback whales in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in June 1978. All seven of these individually identified humpback whales were resighted at least 20 yr after first being tagged, and five of the seven have been observed for more than 30 yr; some of them are among the most resighted humpback whales in the North Pacific. Photos of tagging sites taken during and subsequent to tagging operations show persistent but superficial scarring and no indication of infection.
   These pioneering field studies demonstrated both long-term survival of the whales and the short-term effects of deploying radio tags, which at the time were larger and more invasive than those typically used today.

TI Size matters: Management of stress responses and chronic stress in
   beaked whales and other marine mammals may require larger exclusion
   zones
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Marine mammal management traditionally focuses on lethal takes, but non-lethal (or not immediately lethal) impacts of human disturbance, such as prolonged or repeated activation of the stress response, can also have serious conservation implications. The physiological stress response is a life-saving combination of systems and events that maximises the ability of an animal to kill or avoid being killed. However, "chronic stress" is linked to numerous conditions in humans, including coronary disease and infertility. Through examples, including beaked whales and sonar exposure, we discuss increasing human disturbance, mal-adaptive stress responses and chronic stress. Deep-diving and coastal species, and those targeted by whalewatching, may be particularly vulnerable. The various conditions linked with chronic stress in humans would have troubling implications for conservation efforts in endangered species, demands management attention, and may partly explain why some species have not recovered after protective measures (e.g., smaller protected areas) have been put into place.

TI Using existing data and focused surveys to highlight Cuvier's beaked
   whales favourable areas: A case study in the central Tyrrhenian Sea
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB This study focuses on the necessary elements to implement strategic mitigation in order to avoid Cuvier's beaked whale (CBW) strandings linked to intense sound sources, such as military active sonars, in the Mediterranean Sea. A careful review of stranding data and the analysis of existing survey results are required to highlight the main characters of the species regional distribution. Focused and repeated surveys are needed to confirm that possible favourable areas, such as the Balearic, Tyrrhenian or Aegean Seas, are really favourable CBW habitats. These surveys should be carried out with sea states 0 to 1 in order to minimize the risk of false absence data. Among the regions of interest, the central Tyrrhenian Sea was surveyed with a 12 m sailboat in 2007 and 2008. With 907 km of effective effort, a mean sighting rate of 1.9 CBW school/100 km was obtained, which is amongst the highest densities recorded in the Mediterranean. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Listening to the Deep: Live monitoring of ocean noise and cetacean
   acoustic signals
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The development and broad use of passive acoustic monitoring techniques have the potential to help assessing the large-scale influence of artificial noise on marine organisms and ecosystems. Deep-sea observatories have the potential to play a key role in understanding these recent acoustic changes. LIDO (Listening to the Deep Ocean Environment) is an international project that is allowing the real-time long-term monitoring of marine ambient noise as well as marine mammal sounds at cabled and standalone observatories. Here, we present the overall development of the project and the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques to provide the scientific community with real-time data at large spatial and temporal scales. Special attention is given to the extraction and identification of high frequency cetacean echolocation signals given the relevance of detecting target species, e.g. beaked whales, in mitigation processes, e.g. during military exercises.

AB Various reviews, resolutions and guidance from international and regional fora have been produced in recent years that acknowledge the significance of marine noise and its potential impacts on cetaceans. Within Europe, ACCOBAMS and ASCOBANS have shown increasing attention to the issue. The literature highlights concerns surrounding the negative impacts of active sonar on beaked whales in particular, where concerns primarily relate to the use of mid-frequency active sonar (1-10 kHz), as used particularly in military exercises. The authors review the efforts that European regional policies have undertaken to acknowledge and manage possible negative impacts of active sonar and how these might assist the transition from scientific research to policy implementation, including effective management and mitigation measures at a national level.

TI Navy sonar, cetaceans and the US Supreme Court: A review of cetacean
   mitigation and litigation in the US
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB One source of anthropogenic noise in the oceans which has attracted much concern is naval sonar. As a result of possible impacts of such sonar, several environmental NGOs have pursued legal cases in the United States criticizing environmental assessments conducted prior to exercises and proposed mitigation measures. Cases have been brought using the US National Environmental Protection Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, Coastal Zone Management Act and other statutes. This paper reviews the chronology and results of these various cases. During the G.W. Bush presidential administration, the legal battle went to the US Supreme Court in the case Winter vs. Natural Resources Defense Council. This case however, did not address the potential impacts of sonar on cetaceans or the effectiveness of mitigation measures. During the Obama administration, mitigation measures for naval exercises have been revised, and working groups planned, in an attempt to resolve conflict between parties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Public awareness and attitudes towards naval sonar mitigation for
   cetacean conservation: A preliminary case study in Fairfax County,
   Virginia (the DC Metro area)
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The potential impacts of naval sonar on cetaceans has led to a series of court cases and statements of concern by international organizations. However, there has been no research conducted on attitudes of the general public with respect to this issue. To investigate this, a preliminary public survey was conducted in Fairfax, Virginia (the Washington, DC Metro region). The majority of the public sampled believed that naval sonar impacted marine mammals (51.3%), that the US Navy should not be exempt from environmental regulations in time of peace (75.2%), and that sonar use should be moderated if it impacts cetaceans (75.8%). Individuals who were conservative, Republican, and have served in the military were more likely to believe the Navy should be exempt from marine mammal protection regulations. In addition, expert interviews were conducted to gain opinions on the potential ramifications of the recent US Supreme Court case on naval sonar mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Risk mapping for sensitive species to underwater anthropogenic sound
   emissions: Model development and validation in two Mediterranean areas
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Recent observations of cetacean mass strandings, coincident with anthropogenic sounds emissions, have raised concerns on the potential environmental impact of underwater noise. Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) was reported in all the cited stranding events. Within the NATO Marine Mammal Risk Mitigation project (MMRM), multiple interdisciplinary sea trials have been conducted in the Mediterranean Sea with the objective of developing tools and procedures to mitigate the impact of underwater sound emissions. During these cruises, visual observations, passive acoustic detections and environmental data were collected. The aim of this study was to evaluate "a priori" predictions of Cuvier's beaked whale presence in the Alboran Sea, using models developed in the Ligurian Sea that employ bathymetric and chlorophyll features as predictors. The accuracy of these predictions was found adequate and elements are given to account for the uncertainties associated to the use of models developed in areas different from their calibration site.

AB Marine mammals accumulate mercury in their tissues at high concentration and detoxify by forming mercury selenide (HgSe, tiemannite) mainly in the liver. We investigated the possibility of formation of HgSe in various tissues (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, pancreas, muscle and brain) other than the liver of the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). We applied a combination method of micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) imaging and micro-X-ray diffraction (mu-XRD) using a synchrotron radiation X-ray microbeam to analyze the tissue samples directly with minimal sample preparation. By this method, many accumulation points for Hg and Se on a micron scale were found in thin sections of the spleen and liver tissue and consequently, the XRF spectra and the XRD pattern of the hot spots confirmed the presence of tiemannite, HgSe. On the other hand, the insoluble fractions after enzyme digestion of the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions of all tissues were subjected to X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis. XAFS analysis confirmed the presence of HgSe in all the tissues examined (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, pancreas, muscle and brain) of the striped dolphin. The presence of HgSe in all the tissues examined suggests that Se would be involved in the detoxification process of Hg in various tissues other than the liver. This contribution seems to be large especially in the liver and spleen but relatively small in the kidney, pancreas and brain, because the proportion of insoluble fraction containing HgSe was lower in these tissues (25 to 46%). This is the first report on the presence of tiemannite HgSe in various tissues of marine mammals.

AB The evolutionary process of readaptation to the aquatic environment was accompanied by extreme anatomical and physiological changes in the brain. This review discusses cortical specializations in the three major lineages of marine mammals in comparison to related terrestrial and semiaquatic species. Different groups of marine mammals adopted a wide range of strategies to cope with the challenges of aquatic living. Cetaceans and hippopotamids possess a completely agranular neocortex in contrast to phocids and sirenians; vertical modules are observed in deep layers V and VI in manatees, cetaceans, phocids, and hippopotamids, but in different cortical areas; and clustering in layer II appears in the insular cortex of hippopotamids, phocids, and cetaceans. Finally, von Economo neurons are present in cetaceans, hippopotamids, sirenians, and some phocids, with specific, yet different, cortical distributions. The interpretation of the evolutionary and functional significance of such specializations, and their relationships with the degrees of adaptation to the aquatic environment and phylogeny, remain difficult to trace, at least until comprehensive data, including representative species from all of the major mammalian families, become available.

TI Two Cases of Bacterial Pneumonia in Bottle-nosed Dolphins (Tursiops
   gillii) at the Seoul Zoo, Korea
SO PAKISTAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB Two bacterial pneumonia cases of bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops gillii) were found in Seoul Zoo. Firstly, severe fibrous pleuropneumonia was revealed in a 14-year-old male bottle-nosed dolphin on its necropsy. The clinical signs included anorexia, listing posture, and vertical submerging after the initial signs of low activity and avoiding trainers. White blood cell count increased up to 31.80 x 10(3)/mu l. Despite aggressive antibiotics therapy of intramuscular injection and nebulization it died two months later. At early time of illness Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were isolated. Lately Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the exhaled air culture and direct sample of lung parenchyma on necropsy. Secondly, a 6-year-old male bottle-nosed dolphin with anorexia and tendency to avoid trainers was completely recovered after prompt treatment with antibiotics and NSAIDs for six days prior to diagnosis. The diagnosis was based on history, clinical signs, blood cell count, and mucous culture from blowhole. The count of white blood cell dramatically decreased from 25.36 x 10(3)/mu l to 7.28 x 10(3)/ mu l after four days of antibiotics therapy. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the culture.

TI First Confident Evidence of Harbour Porpoise in the Ems Estuary
SO WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
AB Harbour porpoise are the most common whale species in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, nevertheless the fewest catch sight of the small Cetacean. Still little is known about their ecology in German coastal waters, especially about the abundance and distribution in the estuary of the river Ems. In turbid waters aerial counts prove not to be a promising method. Therefore we describe in this paper how we used porpoise detectors, so-called "pods", to provide the first confident evidence of harbour porpoise in the Ems estuary. At five locations pods were applied in the estuary between Ems kilometre marker 36 to 75 in 3 to 7 m water depth since October 2009. The analysis of data show, that the outer estuary is attractive to harbour porpoise. In a decreasing frequency they enter the inner part, probably due to declining food supply or increasing noise of the shipping traffic.

TI Evaluation of an Alternative to Feeding Whole Frozen Fish in Belugas
   (Delphinapterus leucas)
SO ZOO BIOLOGY
AB Feeding fish to captive piscivores can be challenging owing to cost, availability, variability in nutrient, and caloric composition, as well as handling and storage concerns. This trial evaluated the response of three belugas to being fed Fish Analog, an alternative to frozen fish. Body condition, gut transit time, serum chemistry and metabolic hormone analytes, immune function, and behavioral motivation were the dependent variables. Belugas (n = 53) were fed various levels of Fish Analog (0-50%) over a 6-month period, and follow-up studies were conducted to further examine several dependent variables. When provided in gradually increasing amounts, belugas consumed the Fish Analog, with only minor fecal consistency changes and without behavioral responses indicative of gastric discomfort. Axillary girth and blubber thickness were positively correlated, and did not differ significantly with changes in the percentage of Fish Analog fed. Individual animal variation in initial passage time, some serum chemistry analytes, and immune function differences were noted following feeding of Fish Analog. Feeding Fish Analog reduced blood n9 fatty acids compared with captive belugas fed no Fish Analog. Feeding a DHA-enriched Fish Analog increased several n3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, but not DHA, compared with whales fed no Fish Analog or non-DHA-enriched Fish Analog. Fish Analog was shown to be a viable alternative to feeding fish at up to 50% of the dietary caloric density. Zoo Biol 30: 32-51, 2011. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI From catching to watching: Moving towards quality assurance of
   whale/dolphin watching tourism in Taiwan
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Taiwan has shifted from harvesting whales and dolphins to protecting all cetacean species since 1990. Whales and dolphins have become major tourist attractions. With an eye on foreseeable future growth and increasing concerns about environmental impact, service delivery, and educational efficacy, the government seeks to achieve the overall quality assurance of whale/dolphin watching tourism by introducing an ecolabelling program. The aim of this study is to examine this program by analyzing its impact on tour operators and visitors. A survey method was used to assess the impact. The results showed that the program is having a positive impact on operators by seeking environmental sustainability and has brought about educational benefits for visitors, including: site-based knowledge, awareness of marine conservation and reinforcing intentions to perform environmentally responsible behaviors. However, money cost is a major factor discouraging tour operator's participation, even though ecolabels help to construct an image of responsibility. With potential educational benefits for visitors in mind, the study highlights the need for increasing public awareness of the program, expanding marketing of ecolabelled products, and providing economic incentives for tour operators to engage in ecolabelling.
